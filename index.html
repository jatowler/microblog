			 <p>In September 2021, we spent a couple of days in Barcelona on our way back from Minorca and Mallorca. We had read that a favorite local breakfast spot was <a href="https://americansinbarcelona.com/granja-viader/">Granja M. Viader</a>. Usually, that means there’s a line of tourists out the door, and Meera and I are almost always unwilling to wait in a line like that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, this day, the line was practically nonexistent (probably because tourists hadn’t yet come back after COVID), and we slipped in for a breakfast of hot chocolate and churros.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Two things stood out from this visit:</p>
<ol>
<li>The hot chocolate was in fact thick warmed chocolate to dip the churros in. Those familiar with Spanish or Mexican culture are rolling their eyes, but this treat was new to me.</li>
<li>This restaurant has been serving this food for <strong>150 years</strong>. Incredible longevity for a breakfast spot.</li>
</ol>
<p>When we travel, I’m always torn between visiting the famous spots and being too much of a tourist. In this case, we threaded the needle perfectly and got an amazing unexpected breakfast. ✈️ 🗺️ 🇪🇸</p>

			 <p>Flying west across the international date line always screws with my “streaks.” Games, fitness—anything that automatically tracks daily continuity breaks.</p>
<p>All of these apps need to build in grace days. Either occasional true penalty-free skip days or, like <a href="https://playknotwords.com/">Knotwords</a>, ways to rebuild the streak.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of a conversation in the Apple sphere a few years ago about preserving fitness streaks on rest days or across the Sabbath for observant Jews. Did that ever get addressed?</p>
<p>Shawn Blanc offered <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/2019/11/how-to-have-a-recovery-day-with-the-apple-watch/">a solution</a>, and here’s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gentler-streak-activity-rest/id1576857102">a fitness app</a> with a graceful (they call it “self-compassionate”) third-party approach, but first-party apps should really support this kind of thing too.</p>

			 <p>Finally in our hotel in Melbourne. Quick recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>At 2pm Friday everything was fine.</li>
<li>At 3pm Friday our Melbourne flight was delayed two hours, but our Dallas flight was delayed <em>four</em> hours, so we would miss our connection, and the next DFW-MEL flight didn’t leave for two more days.</li>
<li>American couldn’t rebook us despite my platinum status. Our travel department figured out how to get us there through LAX, but before that a colleague traveling with us with Concierge Key status got us not only rebooked but on standby with a third alternative (which we ended up taking). If only American cared that much about all its passengers.</li>
<li>We made DFW, but all the gates were occupied, so we sat on the tarmac until one cleared up.</li>
<li>After getting into the airport, we closed down the Flagship Lounge (it inexplicably closes at 10:15pm even though the last flight boards much later), enjoying champagne, beers, cocktails, and even some dinner while we waited.</li>
<li>Our Melbourne flight was late arriving, so it was very late boarding, and we didn’t take off until 12:30am or later.</li>
<li>Seventeen and a half hours later, we landed in Melbourne around 7:30am.</li>
<li>Obviously we were too early to check in, so we dropped our bags at the hotel, got coffee and breakfast, and went exploring at the river, botanical gardens, and CBD.</li>
<li>We returned to the hotel for a break before venturing back out for dinner.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s been quite a ridiculous 34 hours, but we are excited to be here. Now for that nap…</p>
<p>✈️ 🗺️ 🏨 🇦🇺</p>

			 <p>In November 2021, Meera and I were itching to get traveling again. We had had our shots, waited past all the international quarantines, and it was time to go again.</p>
<p>We chose to visit Minorca and Mallorca because we had enjoyed Barcelona so much a few years prior, and we wanted to go back but experience something new.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While we stayed in Sóller for our time on Mallorca, one of our favorite days was driving up the coast to Port d’Andratx to visit the lighthouses and see the sailboats at the port.</p>
<p>The wealthy neighborhoods didn’t make it easy, but we did manage to park the car and do some hiking on the hills overlooking the port before going down for dinner and a closer look.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We were lucky enough to catch a class of sailors out training, and they kindly passed in front of the lighthouse like ducklings following their mother so I could catch this photo from the docks. ✈️⛵️🇪🇸</p>

			 <p>I really hate that the best experience of micro.blog is on the web. The Mac app is flaky uploading photos, and while you can write alt text, there&rsquo;s no way to position them in the post. The iOS apps don&rsquo;t really believe in the share sheet (sharing to Sunlit loses my post 100% of the time), and scrolling in the official micro.blog app routinely breaks, making scrolling to the bottom of the post to continue writing impossible. I&rsquo;d switch to Drafts, but I still need to handle photo uploading. (To be fair, Epilogue continues to be awesome, and I&rsquo;ve never tried Wavelength.)</p>

			 <p>In June 2013, I was on a business trip to Mountain View. I had never been to California before, so I spent as much of my free time exploring as I could.</p>
<p>I drove down to Santa Cruz, and I saw the Breakwater Lighthouse.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then I went west to Pigeon Point Light Station near Pescadero.</p>

<p>But despite my love of lighthouses, the vast majority of the photos I took that week—with my disappointing-in-retrospect iPhone 4 camera—were from the San Jose Municipal Rose Garden, which is a thing that exists. Some of them even turned out pretty good!</p>

<p>You’re not permitted to use local “found” firewood, so one of the people with us brought a truck bed full of huge branches we spent a long time chopping into firewood on which to cook a very nice pot of camp chili.</p>

			 <p>In August 2016, I was in Adelaide for a business trip. Okay, I was in Woomera for a business trip, but I had taken a week of vacation on the end of the trip to explore Adelaide.</p>
<p>One day I decided to hike up Mount Lofty. Okay, I decided to walk to Mount Lofty from Adelaide and then climb up it.</p>
<p>The trek took me past a place called Waterfall Gully, which is a… gully… with a waterfall. Australians have the best names: Mount Lofty, Waterfall Gully.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The hike up was quite challenging: 1,000m up in a 5,000m hike. But I kept getting passed by trailrunners getting their vertical 5k in. It was embarrassing. (It didn’t help that the only boots I had with me were steel-toe safety boots.)</p>
<p>After reaching the top, I tried to walk back to Adelaide, but I was exhausted, so I stopped for a pizza and called an Uber. ✈️ 🍕</p>

<p>In Zurich, we were unwilling to pay for a chocolate tour, so we found a review online that listed the places they went and did the tour on our own. One of the places was of course the Sprüngli shop, where we learned about Luxemburgerli, which are basically colorful mini-macarons.</p>

			 <p>In 2019, my wife and I joined another couple for <a href="https://savvyhedgehog.com/backpacking-colorados-san-juan-mountains/">a backpacking trip</a> in the San Juan Mountains of south-central Colorado. On the way back, we stopped for a day at my in-law’s condo in Ruidoso, New Mexico to recover a bit. But instead of resting and recuperating from a challenging hike, we decided to go for <em>another</em> hike in the nearby Lincoln National Forest.</p>
<p>Okay, this one is entirely my fault.</p>
<p>I thought, hey, without 30–40 pounds on our backs, how hard could it be?</p>
<p>But the day was hot and the trail had depressingly little shade, so halfway through, I snapped this picture of us in front of Grindstone Lake, and we turned around and went home.</p>

			 <p>I came across this March 2022 post about <a href="https://chrishannah.me/having-control-over-your-own-day/">having control over your day</a> by <a href="https://micro.blog/ChrisHannah">@ChrisHannah</a>, where they advocate for flexible working hours:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Personally, I think the best solution for people and companies (where the job allows), is if your entire working hours were flexible. For example, you could be contracted to work 8 hours a day, but you are free to fulfil those 8 hours between the hours of 7 am and 9 pm. Maybe one day you have plans later on in the day, so you choose to start at 7 am, and have a short lunch. But another day, you want to go have brunch with friends, so you could start later, or perhaps you just take a long break?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My employer has had for many years exactly such a model: we are expected to be &ldquo;online&rdquo;—that is, generally available and working, not necessarily actually logged into Teams—from 9am–3pm Monday–Friday, and we are expected to log 80 hours every two weeks (we&rsquo;re a research consultancy, so we take both &ldquo;log&rdquo; and &ldquo;80 hours&rdquo; both seriously and literally). We&rsquo;re also expected to &ldquo;work from site&rdquo; Tuesday–Thursday, with Mondays and Fridays being optional work-from-home days. Beyond those constraints, we&rsquo;re free to flex our schedule in the way that lets us do our best work.</p>
<p>As a manager, I often field questions about why our policies are not even <em>more</em> flexible, and even I think of us as stuck in the past in many ways. So I appreciated seeing a proposal for improvement that we have already engaged, suggesting that perhaps things are not always better everywhere else.</p>

			 <p>Since the ongoing implosion of X, née Twitter, began, I’ve been combing through my archive of 15,000-ish tweets across 15 years since April 20, 2008.</p>
<p>It’s the longest record of anything in my life, stretching back further than my oldest Day One entry<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I remember almost all of it. Sometimes that’s good: starting in 2017, I published almost 90,000 words of Bible analysis to Twitter. Sometimes that’s bad: I spent a lot of days over the years angry about American politics—left and right—screaming impotently into the void instead of building something valuable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to change that; moving here is helping. I find that here I write with more intentionality. The sense of presence, permanence, and possession encourages me to think more—not too much more, I hope—before hitting &ldquo;Post.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I suppose there is a longer photographic record of me, but since I didn’t get <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikoncp2500">my first camera</a> until high school, many of those photos reflect my physical evolution, not my intellectual, emotional, or spiritual evolution.

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781628240115">Thirty Questions</a> by Timothy C. Tennent. Structured like a catechism but with answers far too long to memorize. Not a bad introduction to Christian doctrine, but fits better as a study: Tennent clearly expects you to do some of the work on your own. Fortunately, he gives chapter-and-verse starting points. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780281079650">The One Hour Bible</a> by SPCK. Edited by Philip Law. A great idea—not paraphrasing or summarizing but eliding: using the actual words of the New Living Translation to tell the story of God in fewer words.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while this treatment works well for the Old Testament and most of the Gospels, they abridge Acts too much, and the rest of the New Testament disappears until Revelation 22. I know it doesn’t fit the format, but ironically one of the elided verses (2 Timothy 3:16) says, “<em>all</em> Scripture is useful.” 📚</p>

			 <p>We have tried a bunch of non-alcoholic (n/a) beers lately, looking for something that satisfies the desire for something bubbly and refreshing but doesn&rsquo;t have the associated buzz, drowsiness, lack of focus, terrible sleep, and other downsides of the high-ABV beverages we&rsquo;ve come to enjoy.</p>
<p>This is an unordered list of the ones we&rsquo;ve tried with comments where applicable. All drinks with the same name as alcoholic beers are the non-alcoholic versions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://athleticbrewing.com">Athletic</a> - has a ton of different flavors, most of them very expensive (&gt;$2/drink on their website); we&rsquo;ve only tried the beers, not the seltzers
<ul>
<li>Upside Dawn - a golden ale that has nothing to do with golden ale, but is tasty nonetheless; my wife&rsquo;s favorite n/a beer</li>
<li>Cerveza Atletica - my wife&rsquo;s second-favorite n/a beer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brooklyn Brewery <a href="https://brooklynbrewery.com/brooklyn-beers/non-alcoholic/special-effects-variety-pack/">Special Effects</a>
<ul>
<li>Hoppy Amber - not on the top of my list for n/a beers, but comes in the variety pack, so what are you going to do?</li>
<li>IPA - a little bit thicker than a real IPA would be, but without the bite of alcohol to balance it out</li>
<li>Pils - I don&rsquo;t love alcoholic pils, so I&rsquo;m not to be trusted, but it&rsquo;s just as crisp and satisfying after a day in the woods (or the yard)</li>
<li>Hazy IPA - delicious; as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, nearly a complete beer substitute—as long as you only like one flavor of IPA, because this is the only one I&rsquo;ve found that&rsquo;s this good</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deschutes <a href="https://www.deschutesbrewery.com/beer/na-black-butte-/">Black Butte Porter</a> - different from the real thing, but delicious.</li>
<li>Sierra Nevada <a href="https://sierranevada.com/brews/hop-splash/">Hop Splash</a> &ldquo;hop water&rdquo; - a weird beverage that reminds you of beer but clearly isn&rsquo;t trying to actually be beer; recommended despite my use of the word &ldquo;weird&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="drinks-that-have-been-suggested-to-us-but-which-we-havent-tried-yet">Drinks that have been suggested to us, but which we haven&rsquo;t tried yet</h2>
<ul>
<li>Independence Brewing <a href="https://checkout.independencebrewing.com/products/kaw-hop-water-6-pack">KAW! Sparkling Hop Water</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.asahiinternational.com/stories/innovation/asahi-00-launch/">Asahi Super Dry 0.0</a> - <a href="https://www.macpsy.ch/2023/07/18/relaxing-with-an.html">recommended</a> by <a href="https://www.macpsy.ch">@TheMacPsych</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.heineken.com/us/en/our-beers/heineken-0-0">Heineken 0.0</a> - recommended by seemingly every ad on every Formula 1 track for the last few years</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cruxfermentation.com/beer/">crux fermentation project</a> - recommended by <a href="https://micro.blog/jean">@jean</a>, specifically the No-Mo Hazy</li>
</ul>
<p>We still love great beers and ciders, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll see us at <a href="https://thedooryardsa.com">The Dooryard</a> this weekend, but this kind of variety is a wonderful change from the previous alcohol-or-nothing regime.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780310113188">For the Body</a> by Timothy C. Tennent. A critical exposition of the need for the modern church to develop and espouse a positive theology of the body rather than the decades of pure negative theology: “don’t do that; that’s wrong.”</p>
<p>A great starter book on the topic, although the last two chapters are aimed squarely at pastors, not laypeople (they still have value, but not as much).</p>
<p>My primary takeaway is that developing a positive, holistic theology of the body allows us to see our sexuality, our bodies, and ourselves in the context of the complete gospel, not by the light of a few specific verses that mostly just make people angry regardless of what they believe. 📚</p>

			 <p>Back in 2014, there was a Twitter account, or maybe a Tumblr account, that published pop songs as sonnets<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I loved the spin on genre, but I noticed that they were all Petrarchan (Italian) sonnets, which go ABBA ABBA CDE CDE, or Shakespearean (English) sonnets, which go ABAB CDCD EFEF GG.</p>
<p>I complained on Twitter that we needed Spenserian ones, which have a harder rhyme scheme: ABAB BCBC CDCD EE. But you shouldn&rsquo;t complain without offering a solution, so I give you my offering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tho' oft my speech ere uttering seem mad,<br>
Fair Helios signals end of labor&rsquo;s reign<br>
O&rsquo;er you and I, who, lightened, upward gad&mdash;<br>
Ascend beyond the heav&rsquo;ns' celestial plane<br>
Lo, trumpets sound our doom, and promise pain:<br>
Your harbinger I welcome, arms ope&rsquo;d wide<br>
For I, clothèd in joy, will be not slain<br>
Let not your countenance be hurt, nor pride<br>
Know I, and I alone, yield to no tide<br>
No force of earth, nor beast, nor god could quell<br>
The rise and rise unstoppable inside<br>
Of happiness whose bounds no man can tell<br>
&mdash;Now strike! your hands together, join the din<br>
A roofless room, a bonafide boon, within.</p>

<p>After getting effectively to the current endgame (there&rsquo;s no real end, but at some point there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;next upgrade&rdquo;), it occurred to me that the simplicity of the game was ideal for me to try learning Swift again.</p>
<p>I dove all the way into Swift and SwiftUI, first using <a href="https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/">Swift Playgrounds</a> and then Xcode directly. It&rsquo;s amazing how quickly a simple app can come together using all these tools and the crazy-fast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> that is Playgrounds.</p>

			 <p>I just accidentally used the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212757">Universal Control</a> feature built into macOS Ventura. I had set up my work MacBook Pro next to the monitor for my personal Mac mini, where I used to keep my laptop when it was connected to this monitor. So I naturally just hauled the cursor beyond the side of the screen, and it <em>magically</em> kept going onto the laptop screen!</p>
<p>It took me several seconds to figure out that something special had happened and that my cursor had jumped from one machine to the other.</p>
<p>Something weird: how did it know which side of my monitor the laptop was on? It could guess by choosing the direction you try to move your cursor, exactly like I did, but it&rsquo;s still absolutely delightful.</p>

<p>The white iPod (3rd gen, I think) was a birthday present when I turned 17 or 18; the iPods Touch tided me over until Verizon got the iPhone, and that iPhone 5s is still the best design ever made.</p>

			 <p>Today I discovered Merlin Mann&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom">Wisdom Project</a>, and it&rsquo;s the kind of thing at least part of my Micro.blog should aspire to be.</p>
<p>Little snippets that are helpful to me now and might be helpful to me or others later.</p>
<p>Some of them are very #wisdom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like it or not, you&rsquo;re always practicing something. Put another way, whichever muscle you exercise the most can&rsquo;t help but strengthen. Often to the detriment of others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And some are pure Merlin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your calendar represents a portfolio of promises to your future self. Treat it that way.</p>

			 <p>Cleaning out and backing up my college/grad school MacBook Pro (15-inch Early 2008), and the nostalgia is strong in this one.</p>
<p>Sure, its 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo isn’t that impressive, and neither is its 4GB of DDR2 or 256GB GeForce 8600M, but it is weirdly performant on OS X 10.8.3, and the aesthetic is arguably more beautiful and indisputably more fun than current macOS.</p>
<p>The old-school 3D icons for Twitter, TextWrangler, and others are elegant, and maybe we should go back to them.</p>
<p>I did all of grad school on this computer, including tons of Matlab and hundreds of pages of LaTeX, and it’s kind of sad to see it go.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781101885949">The Bear and the Nightingale</a> by Katherine Arden. Takes a long time to get going, but spellbinding once there. Another winter fairy tale. Recommended by <a href="https://micro.blog/hollyhoneychurch">@hollyhoneychurch</a> as a follow-up to Uprooted; good recommendation. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780613572781">Sourcery</a> by Terry Pratchett. The self-consistency of Discworld, despite the total lack of logic, amazes me every time. All of its legends and myths and prophecies are true, just never in ways the reader expects, yet somehow always in ways that blend comfortably with the overall chaos. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780552166621">Mort</a> by Terry Pratchett. Death hires an apprentice so he can take some time off and experience life, and maybe find a husband for his daughter. All of those things happen, but as is common on Discworld, not exactly in the expected fashion. Rincewind cameo. 📚</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780804179041">Uprooted</a> by Naomi Novik. Starts as a twist on a fairy tale, ends as high fantasy. The finale is a bit more chaotic than you’d wish, but the whole thing is a good time. 95% for children, but very much meant for grown-ups. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593158364">The Golden Enclaves</a> by Naomi Novik. I absolutely devoured this book. It pays off the first book’s cliffhanger better than the second even tried to, and while the writing got a little cheaper the story exploded into awesome. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593128879">The Last Graduate</a> by Naomi Novik. More fun in the Scholomance. Cliffhanger from the previous novel doesn’t pay off, but a great read anyway. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593128497">A Deadly Education</a> by Naomi Novik. Clearly written for the Harry Potter set, but profoundly different and exciting and, helpfully, well-written. Immediately a favorite young adult novel. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781466862678">The Bands of Mourning</a> by Brandon Sanderson. Concludes as expected, a surprisingly similar scene to <em>Hero of Ages</em>. I wish we’d seen Hoid more, but the tease of Kelsier at the end was worth it.📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781473208230">Shadows of Self</a> by Brandon Sanderson. Beautiful, tragic, ending. Harsh cliffhanger, but didn’t leave me desperate for more Cosmere like most of this series does. 📚</p>
