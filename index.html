			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780281079650">The One Hour Bible</a> by SPCK. Edited by Philip Law. A great idea‚Äînot paraphrasing or summarizing but eliding: using the actual words of the New Living Translation to tell the story of God in fewer words.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while this treatment works well for the Old Testament and most of the Gospels, they abridge Acts too much, and the rest of the New Testament disappears until Revelation 22. I know it doesn‚Äôt fit the format, but ironically one of the elided verses (2 Timothy 3:16) says, ‚Äú<em>all</em> Scripture is useful.‚Äù üìö</p>

			 <p>We have tried a bunch of non-alcoholic (n/a) beers lately, looking for something that satisfies the desire for something bubbly and refreshing but doesn&rsquo;t have the associated buzz, drowsiness, lack of focus, terrible sleep, and other downsides of the high-ABV beverages we&rsquo;ve come to enjoy.</p>
<p>This is an unordered list of the ones we&rsquo;ve tried with comments where applicable. All drinks with the same name as alcoholic beers are the non-alcoholic versions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://athleticbrewing.com">Athletic</a> - has a ton of different flavors, most of them very expensive (&gt;$2/drink on their website); we&rsquo;ve only tried the beers, not the seltzers
<ul>
<li>Upside Dawn - a golden ale that has nothing to do with golden ale, but is tasty nonetheless; my wife&rsquo;s favorite n/a beer</li>
<li>Cerveza Atletica - my wife&rsquo;s second-favorite n/a beer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brooklyn Brewery <a href="https://brooklynbrewery.com/brooklyn-beers/non-alcoholic/special-effects-variety-pack/">Special Effects</a>
<ul>
<li>Hoppy Amber - not on the top of my list for n/a beers, but comes in the variety pack, so what are you going to do?</li>
<li>IPA - a little bit thicker than a real IPA would be, but without the bite of alcohol to balance it out</li>
<li>Pils - I don&rsquo;t love alcoholic pils, so I&rsquo;m not to be trusted, but it&rsquo;s just as crisp and satisfying after a day in the woods (or the yard)</li>
<li>Hazy IPA - delicious; as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, nearly a complete beer substitute‚Äîas long as you only like one flavor of IPA, because this is the only one I&rsquo;ve found that&rsquo;s this good</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deschutes <a href="https://www.deschutesbrewery.com/beer/na-black-butte-/">Black Butte Porter</a> - different from the real thing, but delicious.</li>
<li>Sierra Nevada <a href="https://sierranevada.com/brews/hop-splash/">Hop Splash</a> &ldquo;hop water&rdquo; - a weird beverage that reminds you of beer but clearly isn&rsquo;t trying to actually be beer; recommended despite my use of the word &ldquo;weird&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="drinks-that-have-been-suggested-to-us-but-which-we-havent-tried-yet">Drinks that have been suggested to us, but which we haven&rsquo;t tried yet</h2>
<ul>
<li>Independence Brewing <a href="https://checkout.independencebrewing.com/products/kaw-hop-water-6-pack">KAW! Sparkling Hop Water</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.asahiinternational.com/stories/innovation/asahi-00-launch/">Asahi Super Dry 0.0</a> - <a href="https://www.macpsy.ch/2023/07/18/relaxing-with-an.html">recommended</a> by <a href="https://www.macpsy.ch">@TheMacPsych</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.heineken.com/us/en/our-beers/heineken-0-0">Heineken 0.0</a> - recommended by seemingly every ad on every Formula¬†1 track for the last few years</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cruxfermentation.com/beer/">crux fermentation project</a> - recommended by <a href="https://micro.blog/jean">@jean</a>, specifically the No-Mo Hazy</li>
</ul>
<p>We still love great beers and ciders, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll see us at <a href="https://thedooryardsa.com">The Dooryard</a> this weekend, but this kind of variety is a wonderful change from the previous alcohol-or-nothing regime.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780310113188">For the Body</a> by Timothy C. Tennent. A critical exposition of the need for the modern church to develop and espouse a positive theology of the body rather than the decades of pure negative theology: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do that; that‚Äôs wrong.‚Äù</p>
<p>A great starter book on the topic, although the last two chapters are aimed squarely at pastors, not laypeople (they still have value, but not as much).</p>
<p>My primary takeaway is that developing a positive, holistic theology of the body allows us to see our sexuality, our bodies, and ourselves in the context of the complete gospel, not by the light of a few specific verses that mostly just make people angry regardless of what they believe. üìö</p>

Incredibly slow start, but every episode was better than the last, and the final scene is worth all ten episodes.

			 <p>I had forgotten how much getting a car serviced costs. My 2014 Altima has been solid since I got it in 2016, modulo oil changes and tire changes, but today it needed some (expensive) help.</p>
<p>It was a lot of time and a lot of money, but I guess I can‚Äôt complain about one expensive trip in seven years.</p>

			 <p>Back in 2014, there was a Twitter account, or maybe a Tumblr account, that published pop songs as sonnets<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I loved the spin on genre, but I noticed that they were all Petrarchan (Italian) sonnets, which go ABBA ABBA CDE CDE, or Shakespearean (English) sonnets, which go ABAB CDCD EFEF GG.</p>
<p>I complained on Twitter that we needed Spenserian ones, which have a harder rhyme scheme: ABAB BCBC CDCD EE. But you shouldn&rsquo;t complain without offering a solution, so I give you my offering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tho' oft my speech ere uttering seem mad,<br>
Fair Helios signals end of labor&rsquo;s reign<br>
O&rsquo;er you and I, who, lightened, upward gad&mdash;<br>
Ascend beyond the heav&rsquo;ns' celestial plane<br>
Lo, trumpets sound our doom, and promise pain:<br>
Your harbinger I welcome, arms ope&rsquo;d wide<br>
For I, cloth√®d in joy, will be not slain<br>
Let not your countenance be hurt, nor pride<br>
Know I, and I alone, yield to no tide<br>
No force of earth, nor beast, nor god could quell<br>
The rise and rise unstoppable inside<br>
Of happiness whose bounds no man can tell<br>
&mdash;Now strike! your hands together, join the din<br>
A roofless room, a bonafide boon, within.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been obsessed with Demonin&rsquo;s <a href="https://demonin.com/games/arrayGame/">Array Game</a> since Andy Baio <a href="https://waxy.org/2023/06/array-game/">linked to it</a> a month ago.</p>
<p>After getting effectively to the current endgame (there&rsquo;s no real end, but at some point there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;next upgrade&rdquo;), it occurred to me that the simplicity of the game was ideal for me to try learning Swift again.</p>
<p>I dove all the way into Swift and SwiftUI, first using <a href="https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/">Swift Playgrounds</a> and then Xcode directly. It&rsquo;s amazing how quickly a simple app can come together using all these tools and the crazy-fast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> that is Playgrounds.</p>

			 <p>I just accidentally used the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212757">Universal Control</a> feature built into macOS Ventura. I had set up my work MacBook Pro next to the monitor for my personal Mac mini, where I used to keep my laptop when it was connected to this monitor. So I naturally just hauled the cursor beyond the side of the screen, and it <em>magically</em> kept going onto the laptop screen!</p>
<p>It took me several seconds to figure out that something special had happened and that my cursor had jumped from one machine to the other.</p>
<p>Something weird: how did it know which side of my monitor the laptop was on? It could guess by choosing the direction you try to move your cursor, exactly like I did, but it&rsquo;s still absolutely delightful.</p>

<p>Little snippets that are helpful to me now and might be helpful to me or others later.</p>
<p>Some of them are very #wisdom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like it or not, you&rsquo;re always practicing something. Put another way, whichever muscle you exercise the most can&rsquo;t help but strengthen. Often to the detriment of others.</p>

<p>And some are pure Merlin:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Sure, its 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo isn‚Äôt that impressive, and neither is its 4GB of DDR2 or 256GB GeForce 8600M, but it is weirdly performant on OS X 10.8.3, and the aesthetic is arguably more beautiful and indisputably more fun than current macOS.</p>
<p>The old-school 3D icons for Twitter, TextWrangler, and others are elegant, and maybe we should go back to them.</p>
