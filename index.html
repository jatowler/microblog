			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780375840401">Eldest</a> by Christopher Paolini</p>
<p>I didn’t realize until the afterword that Paolini was only 21 when <em>Eldest</em> was published. What a masterwork for someone so young, and yet it explains some of the inelegance of plot elements and prose. I almost recognize some of the flaws from my own high school attempts at fiction (none of which, obviously, were published).</p>
<p>A fun continuance to the first book, this time with way too much <em>deus ex machina</em> and Marty Stu going on. But for what it is, an entertaining read.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781618243423">1633</a> by David Weber.</p>
<p>The addition of David Weber got us even more Mary Sue/Marty Stu characteristics, but at least there’s some serious risk in this one, with some major players stuck in England under Charles II, Amsterdam under siege, and Scotland for reasons I don’t understand. Also a shooting war with the Americans’ fancy new weapons. It goes—well, some of column A, some of column B, lots of explosions.</p>
<p>Still, the story is wonderful if you can maintain incredible suspension of disbelief.</p>

<p>A rollicking alternate history with a thousand characters, most of whom can do no wrong. Serious divisions between heroes and villains, and an awkward writing style to boot.</p>
<p>But super fun if you can get past all that. I’ll be reading more.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780349437040">Iron Flame</a> by Rebecca Yarros</p>
<p>I almost don’t want to admit I read this book. But I did. The story is fascinating.</p>
<p>But the writing continues to be without expertise. Yarros forgets she’s writing fantasy, or she just didn’t build a big enough world, or something. And the main character, a special magical girl who really only had one flaw in the first place (some physical weakness), appears to have lost even that—or, more likely, Yarros forgot that too.</p>
<p>The dragons continue to be awesome.</p>

<p>This book about a girl growing up in Nazi Germany in 1939 is hard to get into. It is absolutely worth the patience.</p>
<p>I don’t want to write anything else for fear I might spoil it, except it is one of the very few books ever that has brought me to tears.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780375890369">Eragon</a> by Christopher Paolini</p>
<p>After <em>Fourth Wing</em> I decided I should go back to an older and wiser dragon novel. And yep, it was fun! Less sex, but more more wisdom, and no hokey failures to remember the fantasy realm is not the modern US.</p>
<p>Can’t say it was the best novel I’ve ever read, and it’s got all the standard Lord of the Rings cliches about a young man with an older mentor who turns out to be phenomenally powerful (maybe that’s more Star Wars than LOTR), but I love the slow build to an epic battle, plus the weirdo side characters that keep popping up.</p>

<p>A fascinating, if a bit too prone to run down rabbit trails, look at the 116 days between Harry Truman becoming president and the United States dropping atomic bombs on Japan.</p>
<p>Maybe the most stressful time any President has ever had, although Washington, Lincoln, and Kennedy probably have some feelings about that.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>However, I published 183 new chapter summaries in <a href="https://versenotes.org/chapter-by-chapter/">Chapter By Chapter</a>, including the end of Luke as well as all of John, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Acts, and Judges. Total words: 20,347.</li>
<li>I passed 1,000 email subscribers on December 29, just eking out the win at the end of the year, my third year in a row of more than doubling the list size. Total words: I don&rsquo;t know how to count words in emails in Kit.</li>
</ul>
<p>What were the consequences?</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique visits: 99,625 (up 201.5% from 2023)</li>
<li>Revenue: +∞%</li>
</ul>
<p>The most popular page continues to be a data dump of <a href="https://versenotes.org/a-list-of-books-in-the-bible-by-number-of-chapters/">A List of Books In the Bible By Number of Chapters</a>, which includes numbers of verses and words as well, as well as some superlatives. Its traffic increased by 170% from 2023.</p>
<p>The fastest-growing page, unsurprisingly, is the Chapter By Chapter main page, up 267% from 2023. Unsurprising because it got by far the most attention this year.</p>
<p>Along with <a href="https://jerrytowler.com/2025/01/04/review-health-and-fitness.html">physical health</a>, VerseNotes is one of my two themes for 2025. I&rsquo;m excited to see what happens.</p>

			 <p>2024 was (apparently) not a good year for physical fitness for me. We got in a lot of good skiing and one backpacking trip (to <a href="https://nps.gov/grte/index.htm">Grand Teton National Park</a>), but otherwise I apparently didn&rsquo;t do much to keep myself alive. This post is a bit embarassing to publish, unlike <a href="https://jerrytowler.com/2025/01/04/review-reading.html">the</a> <a href="https://jerrytowler.com/2025/01/04/review-finances.html">last</a> <a href="https://jerrytowler.com/2025/01/04/review-travel.html">three</a>, but I&rsquo;ll try to use that as motivation to do better.</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily active calories up 3.1% from 2023, but down 9.6% from 2022.</li>
<li>Daily average exercise minutes: 31, which is above my goal and <em>way</em> higher than 2023 (+29%), but remember that&rsquo;s an <em>average</em>. I only hit my goal 101 times in 2024. (So how did I average 31 minutes? Full days of skiing and hiking!)</li>
<li>Exercise
<ul>
<li>72.27 miles of walking (down 42.4% from 2023 and <em>58.9%</em> from 2022), although about half of these miles were done wearing a backpack with a 25-pound weight, so it&rsquo;s slightly more valuable walking.</li>
<li>37 yoga workouts (up from 20 in 2023 but down from 48 in 2022), although this included for the first time two outrageously hard aerial yoga sessions with Meera, which I&rsquo;d like to do more of.</li>
<li>27.39 miles of hiking (down 51.6% from 2023). The biggest difference here is that when we went to Ruidoso after Christmas last year, we went hiking every day; this year, we were just passing through on our way to Salt Lake City, and we did no hiking at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When I did Shawn Blanc&rsquo;s <a href="https://special.thefocuscourse.com/plan-your-year">Plan Your Year</a> exercise during <a href="https://jerrytowler.com/2024/12/10/took-a-few.html">our December retreat</a>, one of the two themes I came up with for 2025 was physical health, although I hadn&rsquo;t done this summary yet. Now that I have, I know I made a good choice.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s hard to talk about finances publicly, but it&rsquo;s an important part of an annual review. That said, as I wrote this post, I realized I wasn&rsquo;t comfortable talking about this publicly after all. But two parts I <em>am</em> comfortable with: investments and giving.</p>
<p><strong>Investments</strong>: We invested 8.1% more than 2023, excluding our maxed-out 403(b) contributions. I felt good about this number, because we also bought a car, which substantially ate into our ability to invest on our planned schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Giving</strong>: We gave 16.7% more to charity than 2023, which now represents 5.1% of our gross income (up from 4.7% last year). (What do I think about that? On one hand, 5.1% is less than 10%, which makes me feel like we <em>ought</em> to do more; on the other, the tithe is an Old Testament concept, and Paul says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:7&amp;version=NIV">2 Corinthians 9:7</a> that we should give what we feel called to give. The absolute number of dollars is significant, and we can see it&rsquo;s not only growing but growing as a percentage of our income, so I&rsquo;m comfortable with it for now.)</p>

<p>I hit 21 of my goal of 24, although it&rsquo;s possible one of them (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60653694-the-law">The Law by Jim Butcher</a>) doesn&rsquo;t show up on micro.blog for some reason, so the below list will only have 20.</p>

<p>I actually did less flying this year than last year, despite trips to Tokyo, Milan, and Luxembourg (via Paris). My totals for the last four years:</p>
<ul>
<li>2024: 65,054</li>
<li>2023: 91,050</li>
<li>2022: 62,332</li>
<li>2021: 32,503</li>
<li>2020: 17,874</li>

<p>We also did a substantial amount of travel by car this year, almost entirely in December: we drove from Texas to Virginia and back for Christmas, then from Texas to New Mexico and up to Utah to our new home for the next three months.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780812988703">Rocket Men</a> by Robert Kurson</p>
<p>The success of Apollo 8 is one of the biggest achievements of American spaceflight, or possibly all human spaceflight. I love space stories, but I knew Apollo 11 and 13 far better than this one, so we listened to it on the way to Utah.</p>
<p>The story deserves a better author. This seems to be a theme with me recently: wishing that amazing stories had been told by better writers, or better editors maybe.</p>
<p>Kurson tells the story with excellence, but only most of the time. The weaving of biographies of the three crew members—Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders—along with their wives enlivened the whole adventure and added color to what was already an epic tale.</p>
<p>However, the author was obsessed with the possibilities of failure to the point of repeating them in many chapters; I think he recited the litany of possible SPS failure modes and their consequences at least three times, which fully pulled us out of the story. And the chapter on the insanity that was America in 1968 was interesting, but he didn&rsquo;t tie it to the story of Apollo 8 at all.</p>
<p>Finally, the book wouldn&rsquo;t end. It had about one too many chapters—once the injection back to Earth was complete, we didn&rsquo;t need any more spaceflight story—an epilogue that was far, far too long (necessary, just way too much of it), and end matter that also went on forever.</p>
<p>I recommend this book to anyone interested in the Apollo missions, but be ready to forgive some repetition and inelegance and repetition.</p>

<p>This story is so epic it deserves better treatment. Unfortunately, this narrative weaves in dozens of names and focuses on a few, almost exclusively black women and white men (with few exceptions, nobody else is even named).</p>
<p>It also wandered around the Civil Rights movement, but without a clear aim.</p>
<p>In the end, we were left with a thousand great story elements but no story. (The movie, however, is excellent.)</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780307279286">Say Nothing</a> by Patrick Radden Keefe.</p>
<p>Damn, what a book.</p>
<p>We follow a number of major characters in the Troubles of Northern Ireland from about 1968 to about 2016. I learned much more than I’ve ever known about this history.</p>
<p>The author vividly recounts individual stories so well that the book is basically an interleaved biography rather than a history. He explores anger and despair and confusion effectively. And the details are just amazing.</p>
<p>The only problem is that the book is only lightly structured, and there are so many characters that I was never sure where I was in the big picture of the book. There&rsquo;s a framing device of a murder investigation, but that device only gets us half or two thirds through the book (with almost no signposts in between) and we lose all sense of scale and direction.</p>
<p>Maybe the book is a deliberate metaphor for the conflict in this way, because we also have the issue that the author goes to great pains to say that the IRA were terrorists and then makes the IRA main characters tremendously sympathetic, while doing nothing to justify the British/loyalist view.</p>
<p>Finally, the Irish accent of the voice actor is beautiful, if sometimes incomprehensible, and greatly heightened my enjoyment of the book.</p>

Best biscuit: Bojangle’s

			 <p>My primary desk for the last twenty years or so has been a door that I stained and added a fir border and collapsible legs. It gives me a huge workspace, and it reminds me of my grandfather, who helped me make it before I left for college. However, its surface is not perfectly even, so when I added a nice aluminum-frame mechanical keyboard a couple of weeks ago, the keyboard rocked.</p>
<p>Today it occurred to me to ask my wife for some help, and she suggested a piece of felt under one of the legs. I put the felt under the whole thing, and it worked perfectly. Plus it looks kind of cool against the coiled cable.</p>
<p>Yes, I know they make desk mats, but this solution was already sitting in our house.</p>

<p>These books are always recommended for folks who keep re-reading the Dresden novels because nothing compares.</p>
<p>Indeed, nothing compares. The feel is mostly the same—urban wizard who has a day job sucked into shenanigans with mind-numbingly powerful creatures and/or artifacts alongside an ingénue apprentice—but despite Butcher&rsquo;s ham-handed early novels, Jacka has work to do. I&rsquo;ll probably keep reading, because if Jacka&rsquo;s series improves at the rate Butcher did, it&rsquo;ll be spectactular soon enough.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781526634245">A Court of Thorns and Roses</a> by Sarah J. Maas</p>
<p>I read this book to try to understand why it’s so popular, and I failed. It has all the trappings of a rollicking fantasy: a poor girl from the north is kidnapped by an evil magical being from a land she kind of thought was a fairy tale, where she discovers that not only does the villain have a heart of gold, but he’s not actually a villain, he’s the good guy in his own struggle of good versus an evil she can’t even contemplate.</p>
<p>But she’s a thoroughly unlikable character who is somehow nonetheless a Mary Sue, and the writing is mediocre at best. I would encourage a high school girl who wrote like this, but this author&rsquo;s editor is clearly not interested in helping her out.</p>
<p>Not recommended for anybody. Go pick something by Naomi Novik instead.</p>

<p>What an absolute mess of a book. But it’s clearly fantasy for somebody, and the world is definitely interesting. A better author could tell some great stories in this universe; this author needed to simplify and tell one excellent story instead of trying to set up a thousand future plotlines.</p>

<p>It was not at all what I expected. Quentin is an unlikable main character; Penny and Eliot are hardly fleshed out; and Alice… well, I like Alice a lot. I really get the feeling Alice is the true main character and we’re just seeing it from Quentin’s point of view.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781649374080">Fourth Wing</a> by Rebecca Yarros.</p>
<p>I went into this book thinking it was more YA fantasy. And it is! A special girl goes to school where her mom is in charge, and she learns she’s even <em>more</em> special than she thought! The small-town boy-next-door she grew up with turns out to be a giant jerk, and the dark, brooding, phenomenally attractive arch-enemy-with-a-heart-of-gold becomes the love of her life. And obviously they save the world together, or whatever.</p>
<p>But about two-thirds of the way through, there was an explicit, hardcore sex scene. And a few chapters later, there was another one—more abbreviated but no less hardcore. Not poorly written or ineffective, just shocking to me, the unprepared reader thinking this was basically <em>Hunger Games</em> with dragons.</p>
<p>Still a YA novel by genre, just aimed at not-so-YAs.</p>
<p>The fantasy world also gets routinely interrupted by Earth conventions like giving people the finger or naming the months &ldquo;October&rdquo;, &ldquo;November&rdquo;, etc. What are the chances this fantasy society developed the same Latin-derived month names and insulting hand gestures?</p>
<p>Despite it all, the story is intriguing enough and the writing light enough for me to check out the sequel. 📚</p>

			 <p>In the rolls of the families that first returned to Judah from Babylon, Nehemiah lists &ldquo;the men of the other Nebo&rdquo; (v33) and &ldquo;the sons of the other Elam&rdquo; (v34).</p>
<p>The weird part is that there is no first Nebo or first Elam in Nehemiah.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a nearly identical list in Ezra 2 that sheds a <em>little</em> bit of light, but raises its own question.</p>
<p>Ezra 2:7 refers to &ldquo;the sons of Elam&rdquo; and numbers them 1,254. Then Ezra 2:31 refers to &ldquo;the sons of the other Elam&rdquo; and numbers them&hellip; 1,254.</p>
<p>Ezra 2 refers to only one Nebo and counts merely, &ldquo;the sons of Nebo&rdquo; (v29).</p>
<p>First, what happened? How many Elams were there? How many Nebos? Did the two Elams really have the same number of enrolled descendants? What happened to the first Elam and the first Nebo between Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7?</p>
<p>Second, how would it feel to be the family of &ldquo;the other Nebo&rdquo;—especially when the first Nebo is nowhere to be found?</p>

			 <p>Meera and I were talking about the definition of ska on the last trip to the lake, and today I randomly had a brief clip of a Mighty Mighty Bosstones song jump into my head.</p>
<p>I couldn’t quite place it, but I searched my library for likely songs and came up with “<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/you-gotta-go/1631010761?i=1631010764">You Gotta Go</a>” from 2002.</p>
<p>Turns out it was exactly the opposite: “<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/whered-you-go/321136667?i=321136917">Where’d You Go</a>” from 1991.</p>

<p>“Remember for my good, O my God, all that I have done for this people.”
‭‭Nehemiah‬ ‭5‬:‭19‬ ‭ESV‬‬</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nehemiah could not have known how spectacularly God would answer his prayer. The good he did is remembered in his own words throughout time and around the world.</p>
<p>To be fair, this undying remembrance is not “for his good,” but it is for ours, and we glorify God because of Nehemiah, so perhaps it is for his good after all.</p>

<p>The inside is apparently some sort of digital art museum and cultural archive, but Meera and I didn’t have the time or the energy to tour it in between chocolate and beer tastings while we were in Brussels (July 2024). We almost always enjoy a good museum, but we really didn’t want to spend another day walking around inside when the outside looked like it did in the picture.</p>
<p>So we took the metro out there, observed a super-cool building, then took the metro right back to Grand Place and sat down for a drink and a snack.</p>

			 <p>I converted <a href="https://jerrytowler.com">my microblog</a> to be my primary home page.</p>
<p>First, I converted my microblog to the Alpine theme. I love the aesthetics of the <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/18">Tufte theme</a> (<a href="https://github.com/pimoore/microdotblog-tufte">GitHub</a>) I was using by <a href="https://micro.blog/pimoore">@pimoore</a>, but it hasn&rsquo;t been updated in a while and Micro.blog has been adding features rapidly.</p>
<p>I briefly flirted with <a href="https://micro.blog/mtt">@mtt</a>’s <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/96">Tiny Theme</a> for its flexibility, but I like the out-of-the-box behavior of Alpine better.</p>
<p>But if it was going to be my home page, I wanted it to be a little richer. <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.manton.org">home page</a> is quite stark, which is probably what he wants: it drastically centers the microblog.</p>
<p>But I wanted more.</p>
<p>So I dug into the theme and made a few changes: I added a second column for photos posts (based on a category)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, which meant I had to add a little more space. By default, the column of posts is only <code>700px</code> wide; mine is <code>55em</code> wide.</p>
<p>The attached picture is my previous home page, made using Jekyll’s Compass theme, for posterity.</p>
<p>Two down.</p>

<p>I was worried this would be another summer “comedy” that would leave me cringing, but it was actually a fun, fast-paced comedy/heist with a good performance by Scarlett Johansson, a hilarious Woody Harrelson in his element, Ray Romano doing work I didn’t know he could do, a fun cameo by Colin Jost, and a totally useless Channing Tatum with too much makeup.</p>

<p>A critical reminder that being the kind of person you feel you ought to be is impossible, and that’s okay—perhaps even freeing, when considered rightly.</p>
<p>Burkeman spends a lot of time repeating himself, but perhaps that’s part of the point: by repeatedly learning another way in which we can never “spend” time optimally, he maybe hopes to get just one ounce of understanding through.</p>
<p>That said, I found the nihilism offputting, even though I suspect he would argue that it’s not nihilism but realism.

			 <p>Our first day this trip at Copper was exactly as beautiful as expected, if a bit warm. We spent all day on the eastern side of the mountain, taking the Super Bee lift over and over.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593544853">Slow Productivity</a> by Cal Newport.</p>
<p>What a spectacular book for post-pandemic white-collar knowledge work. Partly philosophical and partly actionable, Newport says maybe we should step back from the cliff of minute-to-minute “pseudo-productivity” and consider the contribution of our entire lives or careers.</p>
<p>The hardest part for me is that I recognize everything he says in my workplace but I’m concerned about how radical even the lightweight suggestions he gives would be. I guess that’s an indication I should start implementing.

<p>This world of forgotten gods where prayer and worship actually affect their powers continues to fascinate me, but unfortunately the writing doesn’t measure up to the story. Too many threads opened without closure, as if the author assumes you can just open the next book. It’s possible to do this well in a series, and many authors have—just not this one.</p>
<p>Enjoyed the read, and I’ll probably pick up the next one, but I wish it had a better editor.</p>

			 <p>Had to renew my driver’s license in person today. Texas allows one renewal online, but today I had to brave the DMV. Or as Texas inexplicably calls it, DPS.</p>
<p>It wasn’t Kafkaesque—it was actually quite easy once I found an office with an appointment—but the wait was worse than a doctor’s office. My 3:40 appointment wasn’t called until nearly 5pm, at which point it took less than ten minutes to complete.</p>
<p>Oh well, I don’t need to do that again for a long time.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781938570414">The Sunlit Man</a> by Brandon Sanderson</p>
<p>Apparently Sanderson’s fiftieth novel, and the last of the four Kickstarter books. Directly impacts the Cosmere, and the first of these weird ones where having read <em>everything</em> Cosmere really helps enrich the story.</p>
<p>A swashbuckling adventure—seriously. But of course with magic and mystery you expect.</p>
<p>My only complaint is that so much of the mystery of the early books is gone—we know so much now about Investiture and such that I’m no longer dazzled by it.</p>
<p>Still, a fun read.

<p>A fairly weak entry in the series, maybe intended as a palate cleanser after <em>Battle Ground</em>. We see a little of Dresden’s psyche, but not much. A short return to the early novels’ PI theme, but with Dresden as a far more powerful, and more broken, wizard. 📚</p>

<p>A fantastic addition to <em>Mythos</em>. Fry picks some of the best-known Greek heros (and one not-so-well-known) and brings them and their complete stories to life. He tells complete stories, bringing in all the crazy background and mythological history and real history. You get modern geography and philosophy and demography alongside Theseus and Perseus.</p>
<p>I have no nits to pick, except that again the audiobook, while delivered excellently by Fry himself, is mastered poorly, so keep your volume knob handy. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781405934138">Mythos</a> by Stephen Fry.</p>
<p>Excellent retelling of the classic Greek myths. Plus some I’ve never heard. If you ever read (or refused to read) Edith Hamilton’s <em>Mythology</em>, you owe it to yourself to read this one. Fry brings the characters and stories to dramatic life, truly retelling rather than just reciting.</p>
<p>The audiobook was absolutely worth it—Stephen Fry reads it himself and is engaging and hilarious as always—although the dynamic range is incredibly high, so be careful with your volume. 📚</p>

<p>The day after Christmas for us is always a chance to get outside. December 23 is often a travel day; Christmas Eve is full of cooking and wrapping and worship; and Christmas is full of eating and unwrapping and family. At that point, everybody needs a break and some fresh air.</p>
<p>So of course we had to take them down to the Riverwalk, where we apparently convinced them to take this very nice picture of just the two of us.</p>

			 <p>In September 2021, we spent a couple of days in Barcelona on our way back from Minorca and Mallorca. We had read that a favorite local breakfast spot was <a href="https://americansinbarcelona.com/granja-viader/">Granja M. Viader</a>. Usually, that means there’s a line of tourists out the door, and Meera and I are almost always unwilling to wait in a line like that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, this day, the line was practically nonexistent (probably because tourists hadn’t yet come back after COVID), and we slipped in for a breakfast of hot chocolate and churros.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Two things stood out from this visit:</p>
<ol>
<li>The hot chocolate was in fact thick warmed chocolate to dip the churros in. Those familiar with Spanish or Mexican culture are rolling their eyes, but this treat was new to me.</li>
<li>This restaurant has been serving this food for <strong>150 years</strong>. Incredible longevity for a breakfast spot.</li>
</ol>
<p>When we travel, I’m always torn between visiting the famous spots and being too much of a tourist. In this case, we threaded the needle perfectly and got an amazing unexpected breakfast. ✈️ 🗺️ 🇪🇸</p>

			 <p>Finally in our hotel in Melbourne. Quick recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>At 2pm Friday everything was fine.</li>
<li>At 3pm Friday our Melbourne flight was delayed two hours, but our Dallas flight was delayed <em>four</em> hours, so we would miss our connection, and the next DFW-MEL flight didn’t leave for two more days.</li>
<li>American couldn’t rebook us despite my platinum status. Our travel department figured out how to get us there through LAX, but before that a colleague traveling with us with Concierge Key status got us not only rebooked but on standby with a third alternative (which we ended up taking). If only American cared that much about all its passengers.</li>
<li>We made DFW, but all the gates were occupied, so we sat on the tarmac until one cleared up.</li>
<li>After getting into the airport, we closed down the Flagship Lounge (it inexplicably closes at 10:15pm even though the last flight boards much later), enjoying champagne, beers, cocktails, and even some dinner while we waited.</li>
<li>Our Melbourne flight was late arriving, so it was very late boarding, and we didn’t take off until 12:30am or later.</li>
<li>Seventeen and a half hours later, we landed in Melbourne around 7:30am.</li>
<li>Obviously we were too early to check in, so we dropped our bags at the hotel, got coffee and breakfast, and went exploring at the river, botanical gardens, and CBD.</li>
<li>We returned to the hotel for a break before venturing back out for dinner.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s been quite a ridiculous 34 hours, but we are excited to be here. Now for that nap…</p>

			 <p>I really hate that the best experience of micro.blog is on the web. The Mac app is flaky uploading photos, and while you can write alt text, there&rsquo;s no way to position them in the post. The iOS apps don&rsquo;t really believe in the share sheet (sharing to Sunlit loses my post 100% of the time), and scrolling in the official micro.blog app routinely breaks, making scrolling to the bottom of the post to continue writing impossible. I&rsquo;d switch to Drafts, but I still need to handle photo uploading. (To be fair, Epilogue continues to be awesome, and I&rsquo;ve never tried Wavelength.)</p>

On the way back, we stopped for a day at my in-law’s condo in Ruidoso, New Mexico to recover a bit.

<blockquote>
<p>Personally, I think the best solution for people and companies (where the job allows), is if your entire working hours were flexible. For example, you could be contracted to work 8 hours a day, but you are free to fulfil those 8 hours between the hours of 7 am and 9 pm. Maybe one day you have plans later on in the day, so you choose to start at 7 am, and have a short lunch. But another day, you want to go have brunch with friends, so you could start later, or perhaps you just take a long break?</p>

<p>My employer has had for many years exactly such a model: we are expected to be &ldquo;online&rdquo;—that is, generally available and working, not necessarily actually logged into Teams—from 9am–3pm Monday–Friday, and we are expected to log 80 hours every two weeks (we&rsquo;re a research consultancy, so we take both &ldquo;log&rdquo; and &ldquo;80 hours&rdquo; both seriously and literally). We&rsquo;re also expected to &ldquo;work from site&rdquo; Tuesday–Thursday, with Mondays and Fridays being optional work-from-home days. Beyond those constraints, we&rsquo;re free to flex our schedule in the way that lets us do our best work.</p>
<p>As a manager, I often field questions about why our policies are not even <em>more</em> flexible, and even I think of us as stuck in the past in many ways. So I appreciated seeing a proposal for improvement that we have already engaged, suggesting that perhaps things are not always better everywhere else.</p>

			 <p>Some friends and I were talking about <em>The Picture</em>—the one you’re proudest of, the one you always want to show people, the one that makes you wonder if maybe you’re actually a photographer after all.</p>
<p>I’ve taken some pretty pictures, but I think the best one I’ve ever taken is of a couple I don’t know and never met, on the beach of Lake Wakatipu in Queenstown, New Zealand. I hope they don’t mind, and I hope if they ever come across this post, they’ll appreciate how perfect their moment was (and say hi!). ✈️ 🗺️ 🇳🇿</p>

			 <p>Since the ongoing implosion of X, née Twitter, began, I’ve been combing through my archive of 15,000-ish tweets across 15 years since April 20, 2008.</p>
<p>It’s the longest record of anything in my life, stretching back further than my oldest Day One entry<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I remember almost all of it. Sometimes that’s good: starting in 2017, I published almost 90,000 words of Bible analysis to Twitter. Sometimes that’s bad: I spent a lot of days over the years angry about American politics—left and right—screaming impotently into the void instead of building something valuable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to change that; moving here is helping. I find that here I write with more intentionality. The sense of presence, permanence, and possession encourages me to think more—not too much more, I hope—before hitting &ldquo;Post.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while this treatment works well for the Old Testament and most of the Gospels, they abridge Acts too much, and the rest of the New Testament disappears until Revelation 22. I know it doesn’t fit the format, but ironically one of the elided verses (2 Timothy 3:16) says, “<em>all</em> Scripture is useful.” 📚</p>

			 <p>We have tried a bunch of non-alcoholic (n/a) beers lately, looking for something that satisfies the desire for something bubbly and refreshing but doesn&rsquo;t have the associated buzz, drowsiness, lack of focus, terrible sleep, and other downsides of the high-ABV beverages we&rsquo;ve come to enjoy.</p>
<p>This is an unordered list of the ones we&rsquo;ve tried with comments where applicable. All drinks with the same name as alcoholic beers are the non-alcoholic versions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://athleticbrewing.com">Athletic</a> - has a ton of different flavors, most of them very expensive (&gt;$2/drink on their website); we&rsquo;ve only tried the beers, not the seltzers
<ul>
<li>Upside Dawn - a golden ale that has nothing to do with golden ale, but is tasty nonetheless; my wife&rsquo;s favorite n/a beer</li>
<li>Cerveza Atletica - my wife&rsquo;s second-favorite n/a beer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brooklyn Brewery <a href="https://brooklynbrewery.com/brooklyn-beers/non-alcoholic/special-effects-variety-pack/">Special Effects</a>
<ul>
<li>Hoppy Amber - not on the top of my list for n/a beers, but comes in the variety pack, so what are you going to do?</li>
<li>IPA - a little bit thicker than a real IPA would be, but without the bite of alcohol to balance it out</li>
<li>Pils - I don&rsquo;t love alcoholic pils, so I&rsquo;m not to be trusted, but it&rsquo;s just as crisp and satisfying after a day in the woods (or the yard)</li>
<li>Hazy IPA - delicious; as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, nearly a complete beer substitute—as long as you only like one flavor of IPA, because this is the only one I&rsquo;ve found that&rsquo;s this good</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deschutes <a href="https://www.deschutesbrewery.com/beer/na-black-butte-/">Black Butte Porter</a> - different from the real thing, but delicious.</li>
<li>Sierra Nevada <a href="https://sierranevada.com/brews/hop-splash/">Hop Splash</a> &ldquo;hop water&rdquo; - a weird beverage that reminds you of beer but clearly isn&rsquo;t trying to actually be beer; recommended despite my use of the word &ldquo;weird&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="drinks-that-have-been-suggested-to-us-but-which-we-havent-tried-yet">Drinks that have been suggested to us, but which we haven&rsquo;t tried yet</h2>

</ul>
<p>We still love great beers and ciders, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll see us at <a href="https://thedooryardsa.com">The Dooryard</a> this weekend, but this kind of variety is a wonderful change from the previous alcohol-or-nothing regime.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780310113188">For the Body</a> by Timothy C. Tennent. A critical exposition of the need for the modern church to develop and espouse a positive theology of the body rather than the decades of pure negative theology: “don’t do that; that’s wrong.”</p>
<p>A great starter book on the topic, although the last two chapters are aimed squarely at pastors, not laypeople (they still have value, but not as much).</p>
<p>My primary takeaway is that developing a positive, holistic theology of the body allows us to see our sexuality, our bodies, and ourselves in the context of the complete gospel, not by the light of a few specific verses that mostly just make people angry regardless of what they believe. 📚</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Back in 2014, there was a Twitter account, or maybe a Tumblr account, that published pop songs as sonnets<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I loved the spin on genre, but I noticed that they were all Petrarchan (Italian) sonnets, which go ABBA ABBA CDE CDE, or Shakespearean (English) sonnets, which go ABAB CDCD EFEF GG.</p>
<p>I complained on Twitter that we needed Spenserian ones, which have a harder rhyme scheme: ABAB BCBC CDCD EE. But you shouldn&rsquo;t complain without offering a solution, so I give you my offering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tho' oft my speech ere uttering seem mad,<br>
Fair Helios signals end of labor&rsquo;s reign<br>
O&rsquo;er you and I, who, lightened, upward gad&mdash;<br>
Ascend beyond the heav&rsquo;ns' celestial plane<br>
Lo, trumpets sound our doom, and promise pain:<br>
Your harbinger I welcome, arms ope&rsquo;d wide<br>
For I, clothèd in joy, will be not slain<br>
Let not your countenance be hurt, nor pride<br>
Know I, and I alone, yield to no tide<br>
No force of earth, nor beast, nor god could quell<br>
The rise and rise unstoppable inside<br>
Of happiness whose bounds no man can tell<br>
&mdash;Now strike! your hands together, join the din<br>
A roofless room, a bonafide boon, within.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been obsessed with Demonin&rsquo;s <a href="https://demonin.com/games/arrayGame/">Array Game</a> since Andy Baio <a href="https://waxy.org/2023/06/array-game/">linked to it</a> a month ago.</p>
<p>After getting effectively to the current endgame (there&rsquo;s no real end, but at some point there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;next upgrade&rdquo;), it occurred to me that the simplicity of the game was ideal for me to try learning Swift again.</p>
<p>I dove all the way into Swift and SwiftUI, first using <a href="https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/">Swift Playgrounds</a> and then Xcode directly. It&rsquo;s amazing how quickly a simple app can come together using all these tools and the crazy-fast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> that is Playgrounds.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video of the first level as of today.</p>

			 <p>I just accidentally used the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212757">Universal Control</a> feature built into macOS Ventura. I had set up my work MacBook Pro next to the monitor for my personal Mac mini, where I used to keep my laptop when it was connected to this monitor. So I naturally just hauled the cursor beyond the side of the screen, and it <em>magically</em> kept going onto the laptop screen!</p>
<p>It took me several seconds to figure out that something special had happened and that my cursor had jumped from one machine to the other.</p>
<p>Something weird: how did it know which side of my monitor the laptop was on? It could guess by choosing the direction you try to move your cursor, exactly like I did, but it&rsquo;s still absolutely delightful.</p>

			 <p>Today I discovered Merlin Mann&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom">Wisdom Project</a>, and it&rsquo;s the kind of thing at least part of my Micro.blog should aspire to be.</p>
<p>Little snippets that are helpful to me now and might be helpful to me or others later.</p>
<p>Some of them are very #wisdom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like it or not, you&rsquo;re always practicing something. Put another way, whichever muscle you exercise the most can&rsquo;t help but strengthen. Often to the detriment of others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And some are pure Merlin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your calendar represents a portfolio of promises to your future self. Treat it that way.</p>

<p>Sure, its 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo isn’t that impressive, and neither is its 4GB of DDR2 or 256GB GeForce 8600M, but it is weirdly performant on OS X 10.8.3, and the aesthetic is arguably more beautiful and indisputably more fun than current macOS.</p>
<p>The old-school 3D icons for Twitter, TextWrangler, and others are elegant, and maybe we should go back to them.</p>
<p>I did all of grad school on this computer, including tons of Matlab and hundreds of pages of LaTeX, and it’s kind of sad to see it go.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781473200180">Guards! Guards!</a> by Terry Pratchett. Probably my least favorite of the series so far. So many moving parts, and the jokes didn’t land for me. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781473215290">The Lost Metal</a> by Brandon Sanderson. I absolutely tore through this book. As usual, Sanderson’s organization awes me, although I couldn’t help but feel he tossed a little too much Cosmere lore at us in one book to prepare us for what’s coming. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593359570">Empire of Ivory</a> by Naomi Novik. More like a log of adventure than a novel. Temeraire and Laurence finally have a hard decision to make, although their expressed value system removes the tension entirely for the reader. Still a fun adventure though. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593359556">Throne of Jade</a> by Naomi Novik. Seemingly totally independent from the first novel except the characters, another exploration into a world where dragons are rare but natural. The pacing is again weird, but the world entertaining enough to make up for it. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593359549">His Majesty&rsquo;s Dragon</a> by Naomi Novik. Learning a new world is always fun, and Novik launches in as if England and France have always used dragon fleets in their wars. The climax is too long in coming though, and too short; similarly, the denouement is precipitous. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780062225733">Wyrd Sisters</a> by Terry Pratchett. The first Discworld novel that actually made me laugh out loud. The Discworld is the same glorious place, but the words—powerful things—tickled me just right. I suspect I missed a lot more literature references than I got. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781101885949">The Bear and the Nightingale</a> by Katherine Arden. Takes a long time to get going, but spellbinding once there.

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780613572781">Sourcery</a> by Terry Pratchett. The self-consistency of Discworld, despite the total lack of logic, amazes me every time. All of its legends and myths and prophecies are true, just never in ways the reader expects, yet somehow always in ways that blend comfortably with the overall chaos. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780552166621">Mort</a> by Terry Pratchett. Death hires an apprentice so he can take some time off and experience life, and maybe find a husband for his daughter. All of those things happen, but as is common on Discworld, not exactly in the expected fashion. Rincewind cameo. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780804179041">Uprooted</a> by Naomi Novik. Starts as a twist on a fairy tale, ends as high fantasy. The finale is a bit more chaotic than you’d wish, but the whole thing is a good time. 95% for children, but very much meant for grown-ups. 📚</p>
