			 <p>Back in 2014, there was a Twitter account, or maybe a Tumblr account, that published pop songs as sonnets<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I loved the spin on genre, but I noticed that they were all Petrarchan (Italian) sonnets, which go ABBA ABBA CDE CDE, or Shakespearean (English) sonnets, which go ABAB CDCD EFEF GG.</p>
<p>I complained on Twitter that we needed Spenserian ones, which have a harder rhyme scheme: ABAB BCBC CDCD EE. But you shouldn&rsquo;t complain without offering a solution, so I give you my offering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tho' oft my speech ere uttering seem mad,<br>
Fair Helios signals end of labor&rsquo;s reign<br>
O&rsquo;er you and I, who, lightened, upward gad&mdash;<br>
Ascend beyond the heav&rsquo;ns' celestial plane<br>
Lo, trumpets sound our doom, and promise pain:<br>
Your harbinger I welcome, arms ope&rsquo;d wide<br>
For I, cloth√®d in joy, will be not slain<br>
Let not your countenance be hurt, nor pride<br>
Know I, and I alone, yield to no tide<br>
No force of earth, nor beast, nor god could quell<br>
The rise and rise unstoppable inside<br>
Of happiness whose bounds no man can tell<br>
&mdash;Now strike! your hands together, join the din<br>
A roofless room, a bonafide boon, within.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been obsessed with Demonin&rsquo;s <a href="https://demonin.com/games/arrayGame/">Array Game</a> since Andy Baio <a href="https://waxy.org/2023/06/array-game/">linked to it</a> a month ago.</p>
<p>After getting effectively to the current endgame (there&rsquo;s no real end, but at some point there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;next upgrade&rdquo;), it occurred to me that the simplicity of the game was ideal for me to try learning Swift again.</p>
<p>I dove all the way into Swift and SwiftUI, first using <a href="https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/">Swift Playgrounds</a> and then Xcode directly. It&rsquo;s amazing how quickly a simple app can come together using all these tools and the crazy-fast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> that is Playgrounds.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video of the first level as of today.</p>

			 <p>I just accidentally used the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212757">Universal Control</a> feature built into macOS Ventura. I had set up my work MacBook Pro next to the monitor for my personal Mac mini, where I used to keep my laptop when it was connected to this monitor. So I naturally just hauled the cursor beyond the side of the screen, and it <em>magically</em> kept going onto the laptop screen!</p>
<p>It took me several seconds to figure out that something special had happened and that my cursor had jumped from one machine to the other.</p>
<p>Something weird: how did it know which side of my monitor the laptop was on? It could guess by choosing the direction you try to move your cursor, exactly like I did, but it&rsquo;s still absolutely delightful.</p>

			 <p>Today I discovered Merlin Mann&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom">Wisdom Project</a>, and it&rsquo;s the kind of thing at least part of my Micro.blog should aspire to be.</p>
<p>Little snippets that are helpful to me now and might be helpful to me or others later.</p>
<p>Some of them are very #wisdom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like it or not, you&rsquo;re always practicing something. Put another way, whichever muscle you exercise the most can&rsquo;t help but strengthen. Often to the detriment of others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And some are pure Merlin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your calendar represents a portfolio of promises to your future self. Treat it that way.</p>

<p>Sure, its 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo isn‚Äôt that impressive, and neither is its 4GB of DDR2 or 256GB GeForce 8600M, but it is weirdly performant on OS X 10.8.3, and the aesthetic is arguably more beautiful and indisputably more fun than current macOS.</p>
<p>The old-school 3D icons for Twitter, TextWrangler, and others are elegant, and maybe we should go back to them.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781938570346">Tress of the Emerald Sea</a> by Brandon Sanderson. Tremendous effort and tons of fun. Lots of Cosmere elements together, and the joy of Hoid everywhere. I just wish he hadn‚Äôt tried so hard to sound like Terry Pratchett.

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593359570">Empire of Ivory</a> by Naomi Novik. More like a log of adventure than a novel.

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593359556">Throne of Jade</a> by Naomi Novik. Seemingly totally independent from the first novel except the characters, another exploration into a world where dragons are rare but natural.

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593359549">His Majesty&rsquo;s Dragon</a> by Naomi Novik. Learning a new world is always fun, and Novik launches in as if England and France have always used dragon fleets in their wars. The climax is too long in coming though, and too short; similarly, the denouement is precipitous. üìö</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780613572781">Sourcery</a> by Terry Pratchett. The self-consistency of Discworld, despite the total lack of logic, amazes me every time.
