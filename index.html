<p>The hierarchy Newport builds up here seems to make sense, but I’m reminded of this Dilbert strip, which makes the point that the medium may encourage certain content, but doesn’t necessarily determine it.</p>

			 <p>Finished watching: <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/956842-fly-me-to-the-moon"><em>Fly Me to the Moon</em></a>.</p>
<p>I was worried this would be another summer “comedy” that would leave me cringing, but it was actually a fun, fast-paced comedy/heist with a good performance by Scarlett Johansson, a hilarious Woody Harrelson in his element, Ray Romano doing work I didn’t know he could do, a fun cameo by Colin Jost, and a totally useless Channing Tatum with too much makeup.</p>
<p>Several excellent laughs, lots of fun, and the space race! Absolutely recommended.🍿</p>

			 <p>All public transportation in the entire country of Luxembourg is free of charge to all riders. And it’s mostly on time. This is a miracle.</p>
<p>This morning, I was leaving Luxembourg City to visit Vianden Castle (still <em>en route</em>) and asked how to buy a ticket out here, since it’s half an hour of train and half an hour of bus and mostly outside the city. A kind employee gently told me, no ticket needed.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780374715243">Four Thousand Weeks</a> by Oliver Burkeman.</p>
<p>A critical reminder that being the kind of person you feel you ought to be is impossible, and that’s okay—perhaps even freeing, when considered rightly.</p>
<p>Burkeman spends a lot of time repeating himself, but perhaps that’s part of the point: by repeatedly learning another way in which we can never “spend” time optimally, he maybe hopes to get just one ounce of understanding through.</p>
<p>That said, I found the nihilism offputting, even though I suspect he would argue that it’s not nihilism but realism.

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593544853">Slow Productivity</a> by Cal Newport.</p>
<p>What a spectacular book for post-pandemic white-collar knowledge work. Partly philosophical and partly actionable, Newport says maybe we should step back from the cliff of minute-to-minute “pseudo-productivity” and consider the contribution of our entire lives or careers.</p>
<p>The hardest part for me is that I recognize everything he says in my workplace but I’m concerned about how radical even the lightweight suggestions he gives would be. I guess that’s an indication I should start implementing.

<p>This world of forgotten gods where prayer and worship actually affect their powers continues to fascinate me, but unfortunately the writing doesn’t measure up to the story. Too many threads opened without closure, as if the author assumes you can just open the next book. It’s possible to do this well in a series, and many authors have—just not this one.</p>
<p>Enjoyed the read, and I’ll probably pick up the next one, but I wish it had a better editor.</p>

<p>Apparently Sanderson’s fiftieth novel, and the last of the four Kickstarter books. Directly impacts the Cosmere, and the first of these weird ones where having read <em>everything</em> Cosmere really helps enrich the story.</p>
<p>A swashbuckling adventure—seriously. But of course with magic and mystery you expect.</p>
<p>My only complaint is that so much of the mystery of the early books is gone—we know so much now about Investiture and such that I’m no longer dazzled by it.</p>
<p>Still, a fun read.

It has just now occurred to me I can post results here.</p>
<p>Obviously, I will cherry-pick the good ones where I made no mistakes.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781645241188">The Law</a> by Jim Butcher.</p>
<p>A fairly weak entry in the series, maybe intended as a palate cleanser after <em>Battle Ground</em>. We see a little of Dresden’s psyche, but not much. A short return to the early novels’ PI theme, but with Dresden as a far more powerful, and more broken, wizard. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781797204550">Heroes</a> by Stephen Fry.</p>
<p>A fantastic addition to <em>Mythos</em>. Fry picks some of the best-known Greek heros (and one not-so-well-known) and brings them and their complete stories to life. He tells complete stories, bringing in all the crazy background and mythological history and real history. You get modern geography and philosophy and demography alongside Theseus and Perseus.</p>
<p>I have no nits to pick, except that again the audiobook, while delivered excellently by Fry himself, is mastered poorly, so keep your volume knob handy. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781405934138">Mythos</a> by Stephen Fry.</p>
<p>Excellent retelling of the classic Greek myths. Plus some I’ve never heard. If you ever read (or refused to read) Edith Hamilton’s <em>Mythology</em>, you owe it to yourself to read this one. Fry brings the characters and stories to dramatic life, truly retelling rather than just reciting.</p>
<p>The audiobook was absolutely worth it—Stephen Fry reads it himself and is engaging and hilarious as always—although the dynamic range is incredibly high, so be careful with your volume. 📚</p>

<p>The day after Christmas for us is always a chance to get outside. December 23 is often a travel day; Christmas Eve is full of cooking and wrapping and worship; and Christmas is full of eating and unwrapping and family. At that point, everybody needs a break and some fresh air.</p>

			 <p>In September 2021, we spent a couple of days in Barcelona on our way back from Minorca and Mallorca. We had read that a favorite local breakfast spot was <a href="https://americansinbarcelona.com/granja-viader/">Granja M. Viader</a>. Usually, that means there’s a line of tourists out the door, and Meera and I are almost always unwilling to wait in a line like that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, this day, the line was practically nonexistent (probably because tourists hadn’t yet come back after COVID), and we slipped in for a breakfast of hot chocolate and churros.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Two things stood out from this visit:</p>
<ol>
<li>The hot chocolate was in fact thick warmed chocolate to dip the churros in. Those familiar with Spanish or Mexican culture are rolling their eyes, but this treat was new to me.</li>
<li>This restaurant has been serving this food for <strong>150 years</strong>. Incredible longevity for a breakfast spot.</li>
</ol>
<p>When we travel, I’m always torn between visiting the famous spots and being too much of a tourist. In this case, we threaded the needle perfectly and got an amazing unexpected breakfast. ✈️ 🗺️ 🇪🇸</p>

			 <p>Flying west across the international date line always screws with my “streaks.” Games, fitness—anything that automatically tracks daily continuity breaks.</p>

			 <p>Finally in our hotel in Melbourne. Quick recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>At 2pm Friday everything was fine.</li>
<li>At 3pm Friday our Melbourne flight was delayed two hours, but our Dallas flight was delayed <em>four</em> hours, so we would miss our connection, and the next DFW-MEL flight didn’t leave for two more days.</li>
<li>American couldn’t rebook us despite my platinum status. Our travel department figured out how to get us there through LAX, but before that a colleague traveling with us with Concierge Key status got us not only rebooked but on standby with a third alternative (which we ended up taking). If only American cared that much about all its passengers.</li>
<li>We made DFW, but all the gates were occupied, so we sat on the tarmac until one cleared up.</li>
<li>After getting into the airport, we closed down the Flagship Lounge (it inexplicably closes at 10:15pm even though the last flight boards much later), enjoying champagne, beers, cocktails, and even some dinner while we waited.</li>
<li>Our Melbourne flight was late arriving, so it was very late boarding, and we didn’t take off until 12:30am or later.</li>
<li>Seventeen and a half hours later, we landed in Melbourne around 7:30am.</li>
<li>Obviously we were too early to check in, so we dropped our bags at the hotel, got coffee and breakfast, and went exploring at the river, botanical gardens, and CBD.</li>
<li>We returned to the hotel for a break before venturing back out for dinner.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s been quite a ridiculous 34 hours, but we are excited to be here. Now for that nap…</p>

The iOS apps don&rsquo;t really believe in the share sheet (sharing to Sunlit loses my post 100% of the time), and scrolling in the official micro.blog app routinely breaks, making scrolling to the bottom of the post to continue writing impossible. I&rsquo;d switch to Drafts, but I still need to handle photo uploading. (To be fair, Epilogue continues to be awesome, and I&rsquo;ve never tried Wavelength.)</p>

<p>But despite my love of lighthouses, the vast majority of the photos I took that week—with my disappointing-in-retrospect iPhone 4 camera—were from the San Jose Municipal Rose Garden, which is a thing that exists. Some of them even turned out pretty good!</p>

			 <p>In 2017, we camped in Garner State Park with some friends and took a brief hike the next day.</p>
<p>You’re not permitted to use local “found” firewood, so one of the people with us brought a truck bed full of huge branches we spent a long time chopping into firewood on which to cook a very nice pot of camp chili.</p>
<p>Food you work for is supposed to taste better, but I mostly remember the work and the time, not so much the food. Even as I type I wonder if maybe the food was fajitas… 🏕️</p>

			 <p>In August 2016, I was in Adelaide for a business trip. Okay, I was in Woomera for a business trip, but I had taken a week of vacation on the end of the trip to explore Adelaide.</p>
<p>One day I decided to hike up Mount Lofty. Okay, I decided to walk to Mount Lofty from Adelaide and then climb up it.</p>
<p>The trek took me past a place called Waterfall Gully, which is a… gully… with a waterfall. Australians have the best names: Mount Lofty, Waterfall Gully.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The hike up was quite challenging: 1,000m up in a 5,000m hike. But I kept getting passed by trailrunners getting their vertical 5k in. It was embarrassing. (It didn’t help that the only boots I had with me were steel-toe safety boots.)</p>
<p>After reaching the top, I tried to walk back to Adelaide, but I was exhausted, so I stopped for a pizza and called an Uber. ✈️ 🍕</p>

<p>In Zurich, we were unwilling to pay for a chocolate tour, so we found a review online that listed the places they went and did the tour on our own. One of the places was of course the Sprüngli shop, where we learned about Luxemburgerli, which are basically colorful mini-macarons.</p>

			 <p>In 2019, my wife and I joined another couple for <a href="https://savvyhedgehog.com/backpacking-colorados-san-juan-mountains/">a backpacking trip</a> in the San Juan Mountains of south-central Colorado. On the way back, we stopped for a day at my in-law’s condo in Ruidoso, New Mexico to recover a bit. But instead of resting and recuperating from a challenging hike, we decided to go for <em>another</em> hike in the nearby Lincoln National Forest.</p>
<p>Okay, this one is entirely my fault.</p>
<p>I thought, hey, without 30–40 pounds on our backs, how hard could it be?</p>
<p>But the day was hot and the trail had depressingly little shade, so halfway through, I snapped this picture of us in front of Grindstone Lake, and we turned around and went home.</p>

			 <p>I came across this March 2022 post about <a href="https://chrishannah.me/having-control-over-your-own-day/">having control over your day</a> by <a href="https://micro.blog/ChrisHannah">@ChrisHannah</a>, where they advocate for flexible working hours:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Personally, I think the best solution for people and companies (where the job allows), is if your entire working hours were flexible. For example, you could be contracted to work 8 hours a day, but you are free to fulfil those 8 hours between the hours of 7 am and 9 pm. Maybe one day you have plans later on in the day, so you choose to start at 7 am, and have a short lunch. But another day, you want to go have brunch with friends, so you could start later, or perhaps you just take a long break?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My employer has had for many years exactly such a model: we are expected to be &ldquo;online&rdquo;—that is, generally available and working, not necessarily actually logged into Teams—from 9am–3pm Monday–Friday, and we are expected to log 80 hours every two weeks (we&rsquo;re a research consultancy, so we take both &ldquo;log&rdquo; and &ldquo;80 hours&rdquo; both seriously and literally). We&rsquo;re also expected to &ldquo;work from site&rdquo; Tuesday–Thursday, with Mondays and Fridays being optional work-from-home days. Beyond those constraints, we&rsquo;re free to flex our schedule in the way that lets us do our best work.</p>
<p>As a manager, I often field questions about why our policies are not even <em>more</em> flexible, and even I think of us as stuck in the past in many ways. So I appreciated seeing a proposal for improvement that we have already engaged, suggesting that perhaps things are not always better everywhere else.</p>

			 <p>Since the ongoing implosion of X, née Twitter, began, I’ve been combing through my archive of 15,000-ish tweets across 15 years since April 20, 2008.</p>
<p>It’s the longest record of anything in my life, stretching back further than my oldest Day One entry<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I remember almost all of it. Sometimes that’s good: starting in 2017, I published almost 90,000 words of Bible analysis to Twitter. Sometimes that’s bad: I spent a lot of days over the years angry about American politics—left and right—screaming impotently into the void instead of building something valuable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to change that; moving here is helping. I find that here I write with more intentionality. The sense of presence, permanence, and possession encourages me to think more—not too much more, I hope—before hitting &ldquo;Post.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while this treatment works well for the Old Testament and most of the Gospels, they abridge Acts too much, and the rest of the New Testament disappears until Revelation 22.

			 <p>We have tried a bunch of non-alcoholic (n/a) beers lately, looking for something that satisfies the desire for something bubbly and refreshing but doesn&rsquo;t have the associated buzz, drowsiness, lack of focus, terrible sleep, and other downsides of the high-ABV beverages we&rsquo;ve come to enjoy.</p>
<p>This is an unordered list of the ones we&rsquo;ve tried with comments where applicable. All drinks with the same name as alcoholic beers are the non-alcoholic versions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://athleticbrewing.com">Athletic</a> - has a ton of different flavors, most of them very expensive (&gt;$2/drink on their website); we&rsquo;ve only tried the beers, not the seltzers
<ul>
<li>Upside Dawn - a golden ale that has nothing to do with golden ale, but is tasty nonetheless; my wife&rsquo;s favorite n/a beer</li>
<li>Cerveza Atletica - my wife&rsquo;s second-favorite n/a beer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brooklyn Brewery <a href="https://brooklynbrewery.com/brooklyn-beers/non-alcoholic/special-effects-variety-pack/">Special Effects</a>
<ul>
<li>Hoppy Amber - not on the top of my list for n/a beers, but comes in the variety pack, so what are you going to do?</li>
<li>IPA - a little bit thicker than a real IPA would be, but without the bite of alcohol to balance it out</li>
<li>Pils - I don&rsquo;t love alcoholic pils, so I&rsquo;m not to be trusted, but it&rsquo;s just as crisp and satisfying after a day in the woods (or the yard)</li>
<li>Hazy IPA - delicious; as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, nearly a complete beer substitute—as long as you only like one flavor of IPA, because this is the only one I&rsquo;ve found that&rsquo;s this good</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deschutes <a href="https://www.deschutesbrewery.com/beer/na-black-butte-/">Black Butte Porter</a> - different from the real thing, but delicious.</li>
<li>Sierra Nevada <a href="https://sierranevada.com/brews/hop-splash/">Hop Splash</a> &ldquo;hop water&rdquo; - a weird beverage that reminds you of beer but clearly isn&rsquo;t trying to actually be beer; recommended despite my use of the word &ldquo;weird&rdquo;</li>

<p>We still love great beers and ciders, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll see us at <a href="https://thedooryardsa.com">The Dooryard</a> this weekend, but this kind of variety is a wonderful change from the previous alcohol-or-nothing regime.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780310113188">For the Body</a> by Timothy C. Tennent. A critical exposition of the need for the modern church to develop and espouse a positive theology of the body rather than the decades of pure negative theology: “don’t do that; that’s wrong.”</p>
<p>A great starter book on the topic, although the last two chapters are aimed squarely at pastors, not laypeople (they still have value, but not as much).</p>
<p>My primary takeaway is that developing a positive, holistic theology of the body allows us to see our sexuality, our bodies, and ourselves in the context of the complete gospel, not by the light of a few specific verses that mostly just make people angry regardless of what they believe. 📚</p>

			 <p>Back in 2014, there was a Twitter account, or maybe a Tumblr account, that published pop songs as sonnets<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I loved the spin on genre, but I noticed that they were all Petrarchan (Italian) sonnets, which go ABBA ABBA CDE CDE, or Shakespearean (English) sonnets, which go ABAB CDCD EFEF GG.</p>
<p>I complained on Twitter that we needed Spenserian ones, which have a harder rhyme scheme: ABAB BCBC CDCD EE. But you shouldn&rsquo;t complain without offering a solution, so I give you my offering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tho' oft my speech ere uttering seem mad,<br>
Fair Helios signals end of labor&rsquo;s reign<br>
O&rsquo;er you and I, who, lightened, upward gad&mdash;<br>
Ascend beyond the heav&rsquo;ns' celestial plane<br>
Lo, trumpets sound our doom, and promise pain:<br>
Your harbinger I welcome, arms ope&rsquo;d wide<br>
For I, clothèd in joy, will be not slain<br>
Let not your countenance be hurt, nor pride<br>
Know I, and I alone, yield to no tide<br>
No force of earth, nor beast, nor god could quell<br>
The rise and rise unstoppable inside<br>
Of happiness whose bounds no man can tell<br>
&mdash;Now strike! your hands together, join the din<br>
A roofless room, a bonafide boon, within.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been obsessed with Demonin&rsquo;s <a href="https://demonin.com/games/arrayGame/">Array Game</a> since Andy Baio <a href="https://waxy.org/2023/06/array-game/">linked to it</a> a month ago.</p>
<p>After getting effectively to the current endgame (there&rsquo;s no real end, but at some point there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;next upgrade&rdquo;), it occurred to me that the simplicity of the game was ideal for me to try learning Swift again.</p>
<p>I dove all the way into Swift and SwiftUI, first using <a href="https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/">Swift Playgrounds</a> and then Xcode directly. It&rsquo;s amazing how quickly a simple app can come together using all these tools and the crazy-fast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> that is Playgrounds.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video of the first level as of today.</p>

			 <p>I just accidentally used the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212757">Universal Control</a> feature built into macOS Ventura. I had set up my work MacBook Pro next to the monitor for my personal Mac mini, where I used to keep my laptop when it was connected to this monitor. So I naturally just hauled the cursor beyond the side of the screen, and it <em>magically</em> kept going onto the laptop screen!</p>
<p>It took me several seconds to figure out that something special had happened and that my cursor had jumped from one machine to the other.</p>
<p>Something weird: how did it know which side of my monitor the laptop was on? It could guess by choosing the direction you try to move your cursor, exactly like I did, but it&rsquo;s still absolutely delightful.</p>

<p>Little snippets that are helpful to me now and might be helpful to me or others later.</p>
<p>Some of them are very #wisdom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like it or not, you&rsquo;re always practicing something. Put another way, whichever muscle you exercise the most can&rsquo;t help but strengthen. Often to the detriment of others.</p>

<p>And some are pure Merlin:</p>
<blockquote>

			 <p>Finished watching: <em>Hidden Figures</em>. I’m so glad this movie exists. Epic women I’ve looked up to forever, especially Katherine Johnson, and now other people will know about them too. Not a movie for nerds—it’s about people and society and space, not technology—but awesome anyway.🍿</p>
