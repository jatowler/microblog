			 <p>New Bible day! I heard about <em>The Brick Bible</em> and thought maybe it was an epic Lego set for constructing scenes from Scripture (I would spend enormous amounts of money on such a thing).</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s even better than that: it&rsquo;s a complete Bible illustrated with 1,400 photographs of Lego scenes.</p>

<p>This sounds normal, except I’m in the United States, where “walking” and “trains” are often unavailable to me when traveling.</p>
<p>Of course, this is ATL, so now I get the all-too-common experience of waiting in line forever.</p>

She is a good fiction writer. I am not. But sometimes I get inspired to write a response. This is one of them.</em></p>
<p><strong>Original Story</strong>: <a href="https://thequilledsister.blog/2025/08/26/today-i-am-gifted/">Gifted</a></p>
<h2 id="my-story">My Story</h2>
<p><em>I try to make these stand-alone, but today&rsquo;s story won&rsquo;t make sense if you don&rsquo;t read <a href="https://thequilledsister.blog/2025/08/26/today-i-am-gifted/">the original</a> first.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>BE NOT AFRAID</em></strong>, I said in my gentlest voice.</p>
<p>“HOLY FUCK!”</p>
<p><strong><em>BE NOT AFRAID, STEVEN WINTERS</em></strong>. I began my litany again, three hundred and fifteenth time today. <strong><em>FOR WE COME WITH—</em></strong></p>
<p>“HOLY. FUCK. WHAT THE HELL.”</p>
<p>Not Hell, little guy. Come on, just let me finish and you can freak out later. They told me this group was skittish, so I had decided to include the name up front, so they would know I was friendly. If I were mean, I would say, “Be not afraid, insignificant bug!” But I’m nice.</p>
<p>I’m on a mission from God.</p>
<p><strong><em>STEVEN WINTERS, WE COME TO YOU WITH A—</em></strong></p>
<p>“OH MY GOD. SWEET JESUS.”</p>
<p>Closer, Steve, but I really need to tell you something, and I have a lot more visits to make today. The days of arks are over, but we still need you to go to the mountains.</p>
<p>I looked around. “Use your environment to your advantage,” they had told me. Burning bush, ladder to heaven, star in the sky, but this was a suburban back yard, which means there must be a… yes!</p>
<p>Back to the human, who seemed to have noticed my eyes glancing about. I hope he didn’t think I was irritated at him for interrupting. Although, frankly, Steve…</p>
<p>It took a few more false starts. “AM I DEAD?”  he yelled, dancing back and forth over the near edge of sanity, waving his tongs as if he were conducting an orchestra at an asylum. “HOW MANY LANGUAGES CAN YOU SPEAK?”</p>
<p>Actually, the surprising answer to that question is “one.”  I speak proto-Babelish, a Semitic ancestor of the Sumerian/Hebrew/Akkadian family. Some call it the “language of Heaven,” but it’s more properly the “language of Eden.” Let’s not get into the “languages” “they” “speak” “in” Heaven. Steve’s not ready for me, and you’re not ready for theolinguistics.</p>
<p>If you could hear it, proto-Babelish is a pretty harsh language, full of guttural noises and glottal stops and also these absolutely glorious vowels that just go on forever. Makes it a perfect worship language. Obviously.</p>
<p>But you can’t hear it, because something about Created beings’ brains just ignores the sounds entirely. You hear noises—yes, I shake the air when I speak, just like you—but your brain interprets them in whatever language you’re most comfortable in, and you somehow ignore the dissonance of your ears and your eyes and your brain.</p>
<p>You’re good at that.</p>
<p>My best guess is that your brain somehow “remembers” proto-Babelish, but the Adamic corruption of the material world has destroyed your conscious ability to process it. So when you hear me speak, your brain kind of panics and retreats to its most primitive responses. Which is where the language of Eden is hiding in the first place, so what was lost gets found, and those with ears can hear. He has a weird sense of humor about these things.</p>
<p>Anyway, while we’ve been talking, I’ve been working on Steve and his gibbering not-madness-yet, and he’s been frantically cycling through a litany of half-remembered Sunday school lessons.</p>
<p>He’s about to land on an important one that happily coincides with both his upbringing and his current location, and if I’m lucky, the ancient ritual will calm him down so I can give him my message.</p>
<p>Ah, there it is.</p>
<p><strong><em>YES, STEVEN WINTERS. WE WOULD LOVE A TUNA STEAK.</em></strong></p>

			 <p>In a recent episode of his &ldquo;Bookworm&rdquo; podcast, Mike Schmitz <a href="https://overcast.fm/+AAG3oMWHceU/1:50:24">said</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are listening to a book, you have not read the book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He doubled down in a newsletter titled <a href="https://practicalpkm.com/hitting-the-cognitive-gym/">&ldquo;Time to Hit the Cognitive Gym&rdquo;</a> (which, amusingly and ironically, offers an audio version):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, I’ve long said that “reading” audiobooks is not actually reading. The audio keeps advancing without you having to wrestle with the message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mike is wrong.</p>
<p>Let me start with two powerful counterexamples that require us to weaken that claim, and then we&rsquo;ll get more nuanced.</p>
<h2 id="counterexample-1-reading-shakespeares-plays">Counterexample 1: Reading Shakespeare&rsquo;s Plays</h2>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays were written to be performed, not read. However, almost all US students first encounter his plays as printed books. This format allows easier asynchronous classroom study, but it is obvious that <em>if you are reading the play, you have not seen the play</em>.</p>
<p>So in this trivial case, reading is <em>not</em> the best way to experience the work or &ldquo;wrestle with the message.&rdquo; Listening to the play being read would be better; listening to it being performed would be better still; watching a recorded performance another step up; and attending a live production the best possible format.</p>
<h2 id="counterexample-2-rich-audio">Counterexample 2: Rich Audio</h2>
<p>My wife and I recently finished listening to <em>The Situation Room</em> by George Stephanopoulos. It&rsquo;s a fascinating history of the situation room, the communication hub of the White House, which I always picture as the set from <em>The West Wing</em>—but apparently has almost nothing in common with that set.</p>
<p>We grabbed the audio version because we like listening on long car rides. We were surprised and delighted to learn that, while most of the audio is just Stephanopoulos reading his own book, the editor inserted actual interview audio instead of just reading the transcripts. The result is a much richer, more nuanced, and in many cases more emotional experience than reading the book could possibly have been.</p>
<p>So in this less-trivial case (an actual book, published as a book, not a play published centuries later as a book), reading is once again not the best way to experience the work or &ldquo;wrestle with the message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Given the emotional content of some of the events the author recounts (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">9/11</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Osama_bin_Laden">the killing of Osama Bin Laden</a>, and others), simply reading the printed page does not permit the reader to engage emotionally as well as the audio book does.</p>
<h2 id="an-argument-im-not-making">An Argument I&rsquo;m Not Making</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly interested in whether listening to a book &ldquo;counts&rdquo; as reading it, and that&rsquo;s not the argument Schmitz makes either—he happily said on the same podcast that for a &ldquo;gap&rdquo; book (his and his cohosts' term for what they&rsquo;re reading between books they read for the podcast), audiobooks work just fine.</p>
<p>The question is whether you need to read a book with your eyes to get everything out of it. Schmitz says yes, and I say that his claim is simplistic at best and often wrong.</p>
<h2 id="entire-genres-where-listening-is-critical">Entire Genres Where Listening Is Critical</h2>
<p>Most poems are probably better listened to than read (e.e.cummings being an easy counterexample; I can&rsquo;t even begin to guess how you&rsquo;d read aloud, for example, &ldquo;<a href="https://poets.org/poem/heres-little-mouse">Here&rsquo;s a Little Mouse</a>&quot;).</p>
<p>Songs, after all, are poems, and reading a song is at least as inadequate as reading a play—probably more so. Any genre or work, I would venture to expand, where assonance, consonance, rhythm, meter, or rhyme matters—would all be lessened by reading.</p>
<p>This category of works almost certainly includes stories from the oral tradition, where they are meant to be heard read or sung, not just looked at with the eyes.</p>
<p>Sure, sustained literary analysis of certain kinds requires reading, but &ldquo;wrestling with the message&rdquo; of a song or poem or oral saga absolutely requires listening. It would be ahistorical and insulting to claim that listeners to oral traditions like the Torah were not wrestling with the message.</p>
<h2 id="the-strongest-version-of-the-argument">The Strongest Version of the Argument</h2>
<p>Given the counterexamples, let&rsquo;s rephrase what Schmitz said to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning">strongest remaining version of the argument</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reading is necessary to fully engage with or wrestle with the message of some works, but there are some works for which reading is insufficient, unnecessary, or both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, Schmitz specifically said &ldquo;books,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ve expanded it to &ldquo;works,&rdquo; which may be unkind. He admittedly doesn&rsquo;t really read fiction, and I would guess that extends to poetry; but as I showed with <em>The Situation Room</em> audiobook, he can&rsquo;t be right about even all nonfiction books.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-would-have-said-instead">What I Would Have Said Instead</h2>
<p>This post is too long already, so allow me to state the best version of this claim, which I think captures some of Schmitz&rsquo;s intent while fixing his most egregious error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fully engaging with a work requires experiencing it in the format its author intended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This version of the claim resolves Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays as well as all or most songs, poetry, and oral traditions. It also allows us to affirm what Schmitz said <em>for a specific set of works</em>: the narrow subcategory of books whose authors wrote them specifically to be consumed as written works and not in any other medium. (Such a claim is strongest for academic texts, where the footnotes and endnotes are critical, or for certain authors like Edward Tufte where the visual presentation of the material is as much a part of the work as the words themselves; an audiobook of a journal article or one of Tufte&rsquo;s works would just be silly, and nobody would argue that a listener to such a thing could engage much at all, much less fully, with the work.)</p>
<p>The only works I can think of that don&rsquo;t fit this claim are those where the author would have preferred a different medium but was constrained: a book that should have been a rich audio experience like <em>The Situation Room</em>, but whose author lived before such a thing was possible or didn&rsquo;t have the resources to create it; a poem that should have been performed, but whose author had to resort to weird punctuation to suggest tones or pauses because ubiquitous recording wasn&rsquo;t possible.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-we-go-from-here">Where Do We Go From Here?</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Reading&rdquo; and &ldquo;listening&rdquo; (and &ldquo;attending&rdquo;) aren&rsquo;t moral categories; they&rsquo;re lenses onto a work. Some lenses reveal structure—citations, diagrams, exquisitely reasoned argument. Others reveal color—tone, emphasis, the crack in a witness&rsquo;s voice. The important part isn&rsquo;t eyeballs but attention.</p>
<p>Some practical rules of thumb:</p>
<ul>
<li>Honor the native medium. Plays, poetry, songs, interviews, oral histories? Listen. Textbooks, arguments, figure-heavy work? Read.</li>
<li>Match your intent. The author&rsquo;s intent matters, but so does yours. Studying to quote or to argue? Read, annotate, and expand on it. Seeking to feel the shape of a story or the weight of an event? Listen and sit with it.</li>
<li>Mix and match. For consequential works (to you or to the world), do both. Listen holistically for context and emotion, then read deeply for precision. Or vice-versa: dig in with your eyes until you&rsquo;re satiated, then sit back and let your ears give you a different perspective entirely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Schmitz&rsquo;s mistake isn&rsquo;t valuing reading; it&rsquo;s universalizing and absolutizing it. The right claim is far smaller but far truer: <strong>to fully engage a work, use the medium that best carries its meaning</strong>.</p>
<p>Or, more simply, if it was made to sing, let it sing.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m playing with alternatives to Google Analytics, because I pretty much only look at one or two charts.</p>
<p>First try: <a href="https://goaccess.io/">GoAccess</a>.</p>
<p>It lives on your server and reads the <code>nginx</code> logs directly and produces very nice graphs. There&rsquo;s a live terminal interface or you can produce HTML files. It even tries to segment out crawlers for you (but it doesn&rsquo;t subtract them from your visitor count, so you have to do some mental math).</p>
<p><em>Update: there is an <code>--ignore-crawlers</code> command-line option, but I don&rsquo;t want to <strong>ignore</strong> them, just <strong>segregate</strong> them. It&rsquo;s interesting to see what bots are hitting and when and how much.</em></p>
<p>Biggest irritation so far: since the generated HTML page does no date filtering at all, you have to filter at the command line. Fortunately, the manual gives you specific <a href="https://goaccess.io/man#examples">examples</a> of how to do that, so I&rsquo;ve written a script and set up a <code>cron</code> job to produce HTML pages for the last 1, 7, 30, 90, and 365 days (yes, five different HTML pages) and put them somewhere I can look at them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave this enabled for a while and see how I like it. Next up: <a href="https://plausible.io/self-hosted-web-analytics">Plausible&rsquo;s free (self-hosted) tier</a>.</p>

			 <p>Two years ago today (July 5, 2023), I wrote in my daily reflection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell myself again that I need to read more and write more. I can do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve published:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://versenotes.org">11 articles</a> totaling 44,506 words</li>
<li><a href="https://store.versenotes.org">14 short ebooks</a> totaling 57,738 words</li>
<li><a href="https://store.versenotes.org/l/psalm-19-book?layout=profile">1 long ebook</a> totaling 7,828 words</li>
<li><a href="https://versenotes.org/newsletter">50 newsletters</a> totaling 52,781 words</li>
<li><a href="https://jerrytowler.com/categories/fiction/">3 micro-fiction stories</a> totaling 2,459 words.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s 165,312 words from my fingers to the world in 24 months.</p>
<p>I was curious about my ratio of writing to publishing, as well; this count isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it looks like I&rsquo;ve written about 774,231 words<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> in those two years, roughly 1,060 per day<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Obviously, some days are wordier<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> than others; I happen to see that March 16, 2025, was a wordy day: 4,276 words. And June 6, 2025, was a less-wordy day: 274 words.</p>
<p>What I haven&rsquo;t said yet is <strong>what changed</strong> to drive those numbers up: I added a daily morning pages practice to my life. My first entry is July 7, 2023, just two days after that quote at the top of this post. Since then, I&rsquo;ve written morning pages on 119 days (about one in six days), but after a slow 2024, my 2025 pace has been better than one in three.</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but the &ldquo;secret&rdquo; for me was a) putting a system in place that encourages me to write every day (my Obsidian daily note creates a new Morning Pages task) and b) giving myself an inexhaustible list of prompts (selected from Internet lists of prompts; my own brain; and asking LLMs for suggestions).</p>

			 <p><em>My sister, aptly blogging at <a href="https://micro.blog/QuilledSister">@QuilledSister</a>, writes short stories <a href="https://thequilledsister.blog">on her blog</a>. Read her stories! She is a good fiction writer. I am not. But sometimes I get inspired to write a response. This is one of them.</em></p>
<p><strong>Original Story</strong>: <a href="https://thequilledsister.blog/2025/06/15/today-i-am-lament/">Lament</a></p>
<h2 id="my-story">My Story</h2>
<p>I knew her the moment she walked in, of course. Her glamours are literally the source of the word, but she has absolutely no tolerance for error. When a woman that perfect enters your bar, you’re in danger.</p>
<p>So I kept on serving the three girls who’d been there all afternoon. They’d started with mimosas at lunch and just kept going. They were easy money for someone like me—a smile here, a wink there, keep the sleeves rolled up just enough that they could see I’m mostly muscle—and I was sure my bed would be warm tonight. It almost always was.</p>
<p>The man in the leather duster kept staring at me like he knew something, but didn’t quite know what. He stared at the beer, too—a brown ale, served too cold at his request—and didn’t say much.</p>
<p>The woman took an easy seat at a table, speaking low to one of our waitresses, presumably a drink order.</p>
<p>I was still trying to work out what she could possibly order when she stood up to take the stage. Tuesdays are spoken word open mic nights here at Goodfellow’s, and it was always fun to see who worked up the courage to walk up front and pour out their notebook into the mic.</p>
<p>Always some English majors, and some wannabe English majors, and some dropout English majors. Sometimes one of the overachieving STEM kids who couldn’t stand not being good at everything. Usually a few loners who really did want to be poets.</p>
<p>No one like this had ever taken our stage. Every eye followed her—mine included. How could you not stare at that perfect ass?</p>
<p>I don’t mean Venus de Milo or Jessica Alba or Flo-Jo. I mean, the cosmic ideal of ass. Yes, her heels were stunning, as were the legs they supported. Somehow even the muscles of her back through the blue off-shoulder top were captivating. And her shock-white hair competed for attention with her sinuous neck. But that ass… one flexed buttock could have sent the whole room into an orgy.</p>
<p>She didn’t, of course. Her control was total.</p>
<p>Her voice was what surprised me the most. It sounded… normal. Almost relaxed. When you’ve known her as long as I have, you kind of get used to the intense radiating power of her voice, even when she’s speaking in a whisper.</p>
<p>But tonight was like she’d found a new gear. A lower one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Tonight, I want to give a longwinded shoutout to my man, Mercutio.</p>
<p>ahem…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She did not need to clear her flawless opal-jeweled throat.</p>
<p>She’d been practicing.</p>
<p>I was in trouble. We were all in trouble.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could steal your girl
But he doesn’t want her,
Tarnish his honor
But don’t squander the love scholar.
The original bad bitch
A casual curse witch…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her poem wasn’t great. I mean, it was delivered with the kind of vocal skill usually reserved for EGOT winners and Morgan Freeman. But the Bard she ain’t.</p>
<p>Not that it mattered; between her body and her voice, I’m not sure anybody but me could hear the words. Well. That guy in the duster—something told me he didn’t miss much.</p>
<p>She finished, accepted the polite applause and ubiquitous catcalls, and glided to the bar.</p>
<p>I turn on the charm, playing up the part of bartender, hoping she’ll leave me alone. Believe me, you don’t want her attention.</p>
<p>“What’ll it be, my rhyming mademoiselle?”</p>
<p>That’s the ticket, overboard on the flirting; nobody in their right mind would flirt with her.</p>
<p>“A friend of mine recommended something, but I can’t quite remember the name,” she purrs, leaning in more than necessary, “it’s a bubbly one, with a country in it.”</p>
<p>Dangerous. She’s just as dangerous from the front as the back—more so, with those damn eyes—and she’s leaking power. She must have enjoyed herself up there to slip like this. I feel myself drowning in her, and only centuries of practice and a wrenching act of will keep me breathing.</p>
<p>“A whole country? I don’t know if I can fit that in a glass,” I say as I pray she’s too distracted to notice my brief hiccup. Probably every male she’s ever met has had that problem and she’s used to it. Every female, too.</p>
<p>I start making the drink she’s obviously referring to as she politely chuckles at my joke.</p>
<p>We are playing a terrifying game. One that I can’t win. Only survive.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of my eye, I see the man in the duster suddenly attentive to our conversation, a hand reaching below the bar. Stay calm, man, you can’t handle this one.</p>
<p>“You’re looking for a French 75, I believe,” I say, sliding it into her hand and winking.</p>
<p>“Yes! That’s…”—she starts her next rehearsed line a moment before realizing that I’ve skipped a step and already given her the drink.</p>
<p>Not smart. I should have played along. But I couldn’t help myself. It’s who I am.</p>
<p>“I’ll be back to hear how perfect it is,” I croak, and race back to those giggly girls, suddenly desaturated in comparison. At least none of them will kill me in my sleep.</p>
<p>I wait for her to take a sip, appearing to focus all my attention on the ladies in front of me. The moment she turns back to the bar, I’m in front of her. Can’t leave her alone for long.</p>
<p>“You’re becoming a bit of a regular,” I venture, thinking she might take the bait and tell me what the hell she’s doing here. Again. “I can add you to the local’s tab lists if you’d like. Gets you, ah, 10% off on Thursdays.”</p>
<p>A vulpine look fades as she finishes turning from studying the crowd,  identifying and dissecting my hook, analyzing the opportunities, and eventually deciding not to play tonight.</p>
<p>“Sure, put me in there, big guy.”</p>
<p>Well, nothing ventured, nothing gained. One more try.</p>
<p>“Lucky for us! And what’s the pretty name of the pretty lady?”</p>
<p>She answers, and the power of her answer rocks me back a bit. I stutter, pretend I couldn’t hear over the idiot up on stage.</p>
<p>“Mag? As in Maggie?”</p>
<p>Please don’t say your name again.</p>
<p>“Mab, my dear Puck. As in Queen.”</p>
<p>Shit.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I had a novel and wonderful experience: “US preclearance” at the Dublin airport. I cannot believe I’m describing a TSA/CBP experience as wonderful, but it was great.</p>
<p>The theory is that you go through US immigration and customs <em>in Dublin</em> so you don’t have to do it on arrival in the US.</p>
<p>The reality is… exactly that. Global Entry in Dublin was fast (and extant, which was delightful), and I just walked off in Denver directly into Terminal A.</p>
<p>I’ve never had issues with immigration in DFW (my most common port of entry), but <strong>wow</strong> this experience felt magical:</p>
<ol>
<li>Because you’re doing immigration at your own pace during a layover, there aren’t multiple airplanes worth of people fighting to get through at once.</li>
<li>At the end of a transoceanic plane flight, I’m typically tired, cranky, or both. Getting into the airport instead of a bureaucratic queue at that point is tremendously relaxing.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only downside was the lack of a PreCheck line in Dublin. I haven’t had to take off my belt and shoes and watch for many years.</p>

			 <p>Just published this weekend&rsquo;s project, an <a href="https://versenotes.org/bible-reading-plan-generator/">automatic Bible reading plan generator</a> for VerseNotes.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Select length of plan (e.g., 90 days, 1 year) or daily reading time (15 minutes/day)</li>
<li>Select what to read (whole Bible, OT, NT, Gospels)</li>
<li>Select whether to read straight through or get a mix of OT/NT/Gospels/Psalms each day</li>
<li>Select grace days per week or per month (free days to catch up or to reflect if you&rsquo;re already caught up)</li>
<li>Select starting date</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve built the plan you like, you can print it out easily or bookmark it/share it with others using the Copy Link button.</p>
<h2 id="build-note">Build Note</h2>
<p>The piece I&rsquo;m proudest of is the dynamic update of what you&rsquo;re getting yourself into. As you change parameters, you get an instant calculation of how long you need to read each day OR how many days it&rsquo;ll take to finish your plan.</p>

			 <p>A fun toy I built over the weekend: <a href="https://versenotes.org/verse-clock/">Verse Clock</a>.</p>
<p>A reader asked whether you could use <a href="https://versenotes.org/a-list-of-books-in-the-bible-by-number-of-chapters/">my table of chapters, verses, and words</a> to come up with a verse for every minute of the day (e.g., John 3:16 for 3:16pm), so I spent a few hours coding it up and voilà, a verse for every minute (well, 1,355 of them; there are 85 hour-minute combinations that cannot be mapped to a chapter-verse in any book).</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like the displayed verse, just click &ldquo;Current Time&rdquo; again to get a new one, or just wait a minute—it&rsquo;s a functional clock you can leave open if you want. You can even switch between 12-hour and 24-hour time.</p>
<p>Finally, you get a link to the whole chapter so you can read the verse in context, and if I have <a href="https://versenotes.org/chapter-by-chapter/">chapter notes</a> available for the book, you&rsquo;ll get a link to them.</p>
<p>This was a fun and quick tool to build; I&rsquo;m looking forward to the next one.</p>

She is a good fiction writer. I am not. But sometimes I get inspired to write a response. This is one of them.</em></p>
<p><strong>Original Story</strong>: <a href="https://thequilledsister.blog/2024/08/04/today-i-am-fatigue/">Fatigue</a></p>
<h2 id="my-story">My Story</h2>
<p>She was old, these days. Not that you’d know it to look at her. Fewer did, too, these days, but she supposed that was to be expected. It wasn’t the streak of gray she kept carefully hidden out of respect for the bartender, who was still denying the existence of hers. It wasn’t the remnants of a bright pink applied in a fit of misdirected youthful energy—not hers, this time; that waitress had been removed the next day, along with as much of the pink as she could.</p>
<p>No, fewer people looked at her because fewer people looked for her. Didn’t they know what she could do? How she had stocked everything just so, using local ingredients wherever she could, but sending out across the world if she ran out of options. How she had brought in only the very best bartenders, the ones who understood what she was trying to do here? The ones who didn’t question when the six-foot-nine thug got a peach mangonada, the alluring goth chick got a single finger of whiskey (neat, but always slightly pine-flavored) for the third time this month, or the Clint Eastwood wannabe got—well, he got a finger of whiskey, too, but without the pine.</p>
<p>Ms. Harliot poured another drink, a tea for a man in a black bowler who could have been from the 1920s or the 2020s, a tea with perhaps a little too much matcha for a true connoisseur, but which he would only remember as delicious. The O’Harliots—they lost the O in those same 1920s when Ellis Island would let the Irish into the country but New York wouldn’t welcome them any further—had always been her favorite bartenders, even back to the first grandame O’Harliot who carted her around by hand before she had found a permanent home. No cockles or mussels, but they all got what they needed.</p>
<p>Every couple of decades she tried out another family, someone promising, someone who had been in before, maybe a few times. They’d last somewhere between a few hours and a few years, and then she’d find herself reaching out to another Harliot cousin who inexplicably found themselves staring at the labels above the bar, realizing that if they just mixed a little of <em>this</em> with a drop of <em>that</em>, the lanky boy who’d been staring into the middle distance since he took a seat against the wall an hour ago would feel a little better when he left.</p>
<p>They all felt a little better when they left. (Most of them felt better on their way up to the bar.) A little lighter. A little… like maybe that weight wasn’t quite so heavy today. Almost as if the emotional gravity in here were a little weaker than it had been on the doorstep.</p>
<p>As he left, the thug almost forgot he was carrying—almost forgot why he was carrying.</p>
<p>As she walked out, the woman with lustrous black hair, a bit too much eyeliner, way too much (or maybe too little) leather, and skin a whiter shade of pale didn’t think of those girls once. Or those guys. She thought about a bass guitar and the boy who played it.</p>
<p>As he retreated, the man with the painstakingly manicured five-o’clock shadow didn’t think the word “emasculated” once.</p>
<p>The awkwardly tall boy had left years ago, trench coat waving in the wind, a bit worse for wear but looking forward to graduation for the first time in his life.</p>
<p>She could do this forever. She’d been doing it for years, and she’d keep it up until she couldn’t any more. She could feel Christina—sorry, Ms. Harliot—feeling her age, feeling the world, but she could also feel a man who had just turned up her street, fuming about his ex, his lawyer, his ex’s lawyer, the judge, the clerk, and every happy man, woman, and child he’d seen in the last three weeks…</p>
<p>The Grudgery was old, these days. Not that you’d know it to look at her. But the people who needed her found her, looked at her, looked again, stepped across the threshold, and, invariably, felt a little lighter.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781250236227">A Psalm for the Wild-Built (Monk &amp; Robot Book 1)</a> by Becky Chambers.</p>
<p>This is the first book on my #TheologyOfRobotics reading list, which is expanding rapidly. A great fiction exploration of planetary stewardship and the relationship between humans and robots. Definitely fantasy, not sci-fi.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the book is about purpose—having one, finding one, whether you need one, whether just <em>being</em> is enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite opinionated, as it paints a rosy picture of a post-industrial society that reached an unnamed cataclysm and had to convert the entire civilization to a state of greater harmony with nature. It doesn&rsquo;t mention any of the violent politics that would have inevitably arisen regarding any undertaking of that kind or magnitude, regardless of its necessity. The humans left alive are depicted as unfailingly virtuous. All this in a quest for answers about stewardship of resources, of place, of planet, of people. The main character begins as a gardener, moves to what passes for a therapist, and finally goes adventuring in search of purpose.</p>
<p>Interestingly for my study, it literally depicts a robot that has theology! The theology is presented as fact by both human and robot. But when you step back, it&rsquo;s not necessary that the robot be a robot for the story to work. The robot has abandoned everything that would otherwise differentiate it from humans: it has &ldquo;parents&rdquo;, it is not immortal, it does not really repair itself. It could easily be a human member of a remote tribe that happened to speak the local language, and I tihnk nothing would actually change. So&hellip; good questions, but not specific to robots, I think.</p>

<p>Previous record was SAT, where the flight technically started boarding before I got on the parking shuttle, but it ended up delayed, so it counts less.</p>

<h2 id="original-story">Original Story</h2>
<p><a href="https://thequilledsister.blog/2025/03/30/today-i-am-mislaid/">Mislaid</a></p>
<h2 id="my-response">My Response</h2>
<p>It was always the same. A trudge down a clean, brightly-lit path, a longing gaze up at the dead thing as if it could somehow hold the warmth that the living thing once had.</p>
<p>People are weird that way, I’ve noticed. They have all these memories of something alive—a father, a sister, a lover, a dog—and yet instead of sifting the memories to find the love they believe has left, they look at dead things instead: drawings, statues, tapestries, as if somehow the pressed and dried trees or rocks or wool marked with crushed flowers and snails have some sort of meaning that their own spirits don’t.</p>
<p>At least this one can tell the difference. I watch them inspect a marble face that isn’t right and dim stony eyes that never held light, clearly comparing the vibrance of memory to the icon of legacy.</p>
<p>Should I tell them? They’ve believed so long they probably wouldn’t understand; that’s another thing I’ve learned about people. They get an idea in their heads, and then they make choices based on that idea, and then they make choices based on those choices, and soon it’s impossible for the idea to have been wrong. They call it “belief,” which I suppose is as good a name as any.</p>
<p>But I shall tell you, since this one seems lost in thought staring at that door again.</p>
<p>There was never a chosen human. Thousands of years of “prophecy” of a Chosen One from a people that believed they were just barely younger than the dust of the ground. There’s that belief again; would it matter if they had all been born just as the latest war was starting? Was it important that they be old?</p>
<p>(They are not old. I am old, although there are many who would laugh at my youth. But this isn’t about me.)</p>
<p>There is a land, they say, where the people climb up mountains for fun. Just to do it. And in this land is a particular mountain that is the tallest. And as if there is more to see at the top of the tallest mountain than there is in a cup of hot tea, these people climb it.</p>
<p>It turns out they’re quite bad at it. Their lungs are not adapted to the altitude, and their fur is too thin and light for the cold, and their legs are really meant for distance running, not mountain climbing. For one thing, their knees go the wrong way.</p>
<p>But there are some other people who live near the mountain, whose lungs and hair are adapted for the mountain (although their knees still go the wrong way). When they climb the mountain, these two groups always go together: the adventure-seekers and the locals.</p>
<p>When they get to the top, who has climbed the mountain?</p>
<p>The one who saw it as a triumph to be achieved? Or the companion who made it possible to accomplish? The latter would never have left their home without the former; the former would never have reached the top alive alone.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve told you this fable, and you are to them as I to you, what prophecy would you write of these opposites who go up in the cold? Light and dark, thin of hair and rich of mane, backward of knee and—seriously, if you want to climb a mountain, look at a goat. Which way do their legs bend?</p>
<p>Anyway, I wrote that prophecy, and I said there would be a Chosen One. And there was. But who is to say which was which? The one who is dead or the one who mourns the dead thing by staring at a rock?</p>
<p>Their lives cannot be pulled apart any more than the threads of the tapestries depicting them could be unwoven and the image still stand. Their prophecies are not just intertwined, they are the same.</p>
<p>But for some reason, this allegedly wise old culture decided in the unremembered past that there can be only one, and they believed it so hard that they made it come true.</p>
<p>Well, sort of. One is remembered, and one remembers.</p>
<p>Humans are weird that way.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780375840401">Eldest</a> by Christopher Paolini</p>
<p>I didn’t realize until the afterword that Paolini was only 21 when <em>Eldest</em> was published. What a masterwork for someone so young, and yet it explains some of the inelegance of plot elements and prose. I almost recognize some of the flaws from my own high school attempts at fiction (none of which, obviously, were published).</p>
<p>A fun continuance to the first book, this time with way too much <em>deus ex machina</em> and Marty Stu going on. But for what it is, an entertaining read.</p>

<p>The addition of David Weber got us even more Mary Sue/Marty Stu characteristics, but at least there’s some serious risk in this one, with some major players stuck in England under Charles II, Amsterdam under siege, and Scotland for reasons I don’t understand. Also a shooting war with the Americans’ fancy new weapons. It goes—well, some of column A, some of column B, lots of explosions.</p>
<p>Still, the story is wonderful if you can maintain incredible suspension of disbelief.</p>

<p>I almost don’t want to admit I read this book. But I did. The story is fascinating.</p>
<p>But the writing continues to be without expertise. Yarros forgets she’s writing fantasy, or she just didn’t build a big enough world, or something. And the main character, a special magical girl who really only had one flaw in the first place (some physical weakness), appears to have lost even that—or, more likely, Yarros forgot that too.</p>
<p>The dragons continue to be awesome.</p>

<p>After <em>Fourth Wing</em> I decided I should go back to an older and wiser dragon novel. And yep, it was fun! Less sex, but more more wisdom, and no hokey failures to remember the fantasy realm is not the modern US.</p>
<p>Can’t say it was the best novel I’ve ever read, and it’s got all the standard Lord of the Rings cliches about a young man with an older mentor who turns out to be phenomenally powerful (maybe that’s more Star Wars than LOTR), but I love the slow build to an epic battle, plus the weirdo side characters that keep popping up.</p>

<p>This year marked a huge turning point, as I published the very first <a href="https://store.versenotes.org">VerseNotes products</a> and made the very first dollar I&rsquo;ve ever made online, and then a few more. VerseNotes currently represents about 0.02% of our income.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first review what I did, then the results.</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote just <strong>3</strong> new articles, two in January and one in July. Total words: 3,938.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://versenotes.org/fishing-for-men-naming-the-disciples/">Fishing for Men: Naming Jesus&rsquo;s Disciples</a></li>
<li><a href="https://versenotes.org/fishing-for-men-calling-the-disciples/">Fishing for Men: Calling Jesus&rsquo;s Disciples</a></li>
<li><a href="https://versenotes.org/why-does-daniel-go-by-his-hebrew-name-but-his-friends-go-by-their-chaldean-names/">Why Does Daniel Go By His Hebrew Name, But His Friends Go By Their Chaldean Names?</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, I published 183 new chapter summaries in <a href="https://versenotes.org/chapter-by-chapter/">Chapter By Chapter</a>, including the end of Luke as well as all of John, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Acts, and Judges. Total words: 20,347.</li>
<li>I passed 1,000 email subscribers on December 29, just eking out the win at the end of the year, my third year in a row of more than doubling the list size. Total words: I don&rsquo;t know how to count words in emails in Kit.</li>
</ul>
<p>What were the consequences?</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique visits: 99,625 (up 201.5% from 2023)</li>
<li>Revenue: +∞%</li>
</ul>
<p>The most popular page continues to be a data dump of <a href="https://versenotes.org/a-list-of-books-in-the-bible-by-number-of-chapters/">A List of Books In the Bible By Number of Chapters</a>, which includes numbers of verses and words as well, as well as some superlatives. Its traffic increased by 170% from 2023.</p>
<p>The fastest-growing page, unsurprisingly, is the Chapter By Chapter main page, up 267% from 2023. Unsurprising because it got by far the most attention this year.</p>
<p>Along with <a href="https://jerrytowler.com/2025/01/04/review-health-and-fitness.html">physical health</a>, VerseNotes is one of my two themes for 2025. I&rsquo;m excited to see what happens.</p>

			 <p>2024 was (apparently) not a good year for physical fitness for me. We got in a lot of good skiing and one backpacking trip (to <a href="https://nps.gov/grte/index.htm">Grand Teton National Park</a>), but otherwise I apparently didn&rsquo;t do much to keep myself alive. This post is a bit embarassing to publish, unlike <a href="https://jerrytowler.com/2025/01/04/review-reading.html">the</a> <a href="https://jerrytowler.com/2025/01/04/review-finances.html">last</a> <a href="https://jerrytowler.com/2025/01/04/review-travel.html">three</a>, but I&rsquo;ll try to use that as motivation to do better.</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily active calories up 3.1% from 2023, but down 9.6% from 2022.</li>
<li>Daily average exercise minutes: 31, which is above my goal and <em>way</em> higher than 2023 (+29%), but remember that&rsquo;s an <em>average</em>. I only hit my goal 101 times in 2024. (So how did I average 31 minutes? Full days of skiing and hiking!)</li>
<li>Exercise
<ul>
<li>72.27 miles of walking (down 42.4% from 2023 and <em>58.9%</em> from 2022), although about half of these miles were done wearing a backpack with a 25-pound weight, so it&rsquo;s slightly more valuable walking.</li>
<li>37 yoga workouts (up from 20 in 2023 but down from 48 in 2022), although this included for the first time two outrageously hard aerial yoga sessions with Meera, which I&rsquo;d like to do more of.</li>
<li>27.39 miles of hiking (down 51.6% from 2023). The biggest difference here is that when we went to Ruidoso after Christmas last year, we went hiking every day; this year, we were just passing through on our way to Salt Lake City, and we did no hiking at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When I did Shawn Blanc&rsquo;s <a href="https://special.thefocuscourse.com/plan-your-year">Plan Your Year</a> exercise during <a href="https://jerrytowler.com/2024/12/10/took-a-few.html">our December retreat</a>, one of the two themes I came up with for 2025 was physical health, although I hadn&rsquo;t done this summary yet. Now that I have, I know I made a good choice.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s hard to talk about finances publicly, but it&rsquo;s an important part of an annual review. That said, as I wrote this post, I realized I wasn&rsquo;t comfortable talking about this publicly after all. But two parts I <em>am</em> comfortable with: investments and giving.</p>
<p><strong>Investments</strong>: We invested 8.1% more than 2023, excluding our maxed-out 403(b) contributions. I felt good about this number, because we also bought a car, which substantially ate into our ability to invest on our planned schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Giving</strong>: We gave 16.7% more to charity than 2023, which now represents 5.1% of our gross income (up from 4.7% last year). (What do I think about that? On one hand, 5.1% is less than 10%, which makes me feel like we <em>ought</em> to do more; on the other, the tithe is an Old Testament concept, and Paul says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:7&amp;version=NIV">2 Corinthians 9:7</a> that we should give what we feel called to give. The absolute number of dollars is significant, and we can see it&rsquo;s not only growing but growing as a percentage of our income, so I&rsquo;m comfortable with it for now.)</p>

			 <p>Reading is actually first on my personal review of each year, but I wanted to play with the photo collections, so <a href="https://jerrytowler.com/2025/01/04/review-travel.html">I started with travel</a>. I keep an up-to-date list of <a href="https://jerrytowler.com/reading/">books I&rsquo;m reading and have read</a>, but here&rsquo;s 2024 for posterity, or something.</p>
<p>I hit 21 of my goal of 24, although it&rsquo;s possible one of them (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60653694-the-law">The Law by Jim Butcher</a>) doesn&rsquo;t show up on micro.blog for some reason, so the below list will only have 20.</p>

<p>I actually did less flying this year than last year, despite trips to Tokyo, Milan, and Luxembourg (via Paris). My totals for the last four years:</p>
<ul>
<li>2024: 65,054</li>
<li>2023: 91,050</li>
<li>2022: 62,332</li>
<li>2021: 32,503</li>
<li>2020: 17,874</li>
</ul>
<p>We also did a substantial amount of travel by car this year, almost entirely in December: we drove from Texas to Virginia and back for Christmas, then from Texas to New Mexico and up to Utah to our new home for the next three months.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780812988703">Rocket Men</a> by Robert Kurson</p>
<p>The success of Apollo 8 is one of the biggest achievements of American spaceflight, or possibly all human spaceflight. I love space stories, but I knew Apollo 11 and 13 far better than this one, so we listened to it on the way to Utah.</p>
<p>The story deserves a better author. This seems to be a theme with me recently: wishing that amazing stories had been told by better writers, or better editors maybe.</p>
<p>Kurson tells the story with excellence, but only most of the time. The weaving of biographies of the three crew members—Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders—along with their wives enlivened the whole adventure and added color to what was already an epic tale.</p>
<p>However, the author was obsessed with the possibilities of failure to the point of repeating them in many chapters; I think he recited the litany of possible SPS failure modes and their consequences at least three times, which fully pulled us out of the story. And the chapter on the insanity that was America in 1968 was interesting, but he didn&rsquo;t tie it to the story of Apollo 8 at all.</p>
<p>Finally, the book wouldn&rsquo;t end. It had about one too many chapters—once the injection back to Earth was complete, we didn&rsquo;t need any more spaceflight story—an epilogue that was far, far too long (necessary, just way too much of it), and end matter that also went on forever.</p>
<p>I recommend this book to anyone interested in the Apollo missions, but be ready to forgive some repetition and inelegance and repetition.</p>

			 <p>Getting some coffee and WiFi at Downshift Brewing in Ruidoso. Got a few hours of work in with a view of the river and some decorations being taken down.</p>
<p>Hopefully we’ll be back later today to, uh, downshift from caffeine to alcohol; their beer is good too.</p>

<p>This story is so epic it deserves better treatment. Unfortunately, this narrative weaves in dozens of names and focuses on a few, almost exclusively black women and white men (with few exceptions, nobody else is even named).</p>
<p>It also wandered around the Civil Rights movement, but without a clear aim.</p>
<p>In the end, we were left with a thousand great story elements but no story. (The movie, however, is excellent.)</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780307279286">Say Nothing</a> by Patrick Radden Keefe.</p>
<p>Damn, what a book.</p>
<p>We follow a number of major characters in the Troubles of Northern Ireland from about 1968 to about 2016. I learned much more than I’ve ever known about this history.</p>
<p>The author vividly recounts individual stories so well that the book is basically an interleaved biography rather than a history. He explores anger and despair and confusion effectively. And the details are just amazing.</p>
<p>The only problem is that the book is only lightly structured, and there are so many characters that I was never sure where I was in the big picture of the book. There&rsquo;s a framing device of a murder investigation, but that device only gets us half or two thirds through the book (with almost no signposts in between) and we lose all sense of scale and direction.</p>
<p>Maybe the book is a deliberate metaphor for the conflict in this way, because we also have the issue that the author goes to great pains to say that the IRA were terrorists and then makes the IRA main characters tremendously sympathetic, while doing nothing to justify the British/loyalist view.</p>
<p>Finally, the Irish accent of the voice actor is beautiful, if sometimes incomprehensible, and greatly heightened my enjoyment of the book.</p>

			 <p>My primary desk for the last twenty years or so has been a door that I stained and added a fir border and collapsible legs. It gives me a huge workspace, and it reminds me of my grandfather, who helped me make it before I left for college. However, its surface is not perfectly even, so when I added a nice aluminum-frame mechanical keyboard a couple of weeks ago, the keyboard rocked.</p>
<p>Today it occurred to me to ask my wife for some help, and she suggested a piece of felt under one of the legs. I put the felt under the whole thing, and it worked perfectly. Plus it looks kind of cool against the coiled cable.</p>
<p>Yes, I know they make desk mats, but this solution was already sitting in our house.</p>

<p>These books are always recommended for folks who keep re-reading the Dresden novels because nothing compares.</p>
<p>Indeed, nothing compares. The feel is mostly the same—urban wizard who has a day job sucked into shenanigans with mind-numbingly powerful creatures and/or artifacts alongside an ingénue apprentice—but despite Butcher&rsquo;s ham-handed early novels, Jacka has work to do. I&rsquo;ll probably keep reading, because if Jacka&rsquo;s series improves at the rate Butcher did, it&rsquo;ll be spectactular soon enough.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781526634245">A Court of Thorns and Roses</a> by Sarah J. Maas</p>
<p>I read this book to try to understand why it’s so popular, and I failed. It has all the trappings of a rollicking fantasy: a poor girl from the north is kidnapped by an evil magical being from a land she kind of thought was a fairy tale, where she discovers that not only does the villain have a heart of gold, but he’s not actually a villain, he’s the good guy in his own struggle of good versus an evil she can’t even contemplate.</p>
<p>But she’s a thoroughly unlikable character who is somehow nonetheless a Mary Sue, and the writing is mediocre at best. I would encourage a high school girl who wrote like this, but this author&rsquo;s editor is clearly not interested in helping her out.</p>
<p>Not recommended for anybody. Go pick something by Naomi Novik instead.</p>

<p>What an absolute mess of a book. But it’s clearly fantasy for somebody, and the world is definitely interesting. A better author could tell some great stories in this universe; this author needed to simplify and tell one excellent story instead of trying to set up a thousand future plotlines.</p>

<p>It was not at all what I expected. Quentin is an unlikable main character; Penny and Eliot are hardly fleshed out; and Alice… well, I like Alice a lot. I really get the feeling Alice is the true main character and we’re just seeing it from Quentin’s point of view.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781649374080">Fourth Wing</a> by Rebecca Yarros.</p>
<p>I went into this book thinking it was more YA fantasy. And it is! A special girl goes to school where her mom is in charge, and she learns she’s even <em>more</em> special than she thought! The small-town boy-next-door she grew up with turns out to be a giant jerk, and the dark, brooding, phenomenally attractive arch-enemy-with-a-heart-of-gold becomes the love of her life. And obviously they save the world together, or whatever.</p>
<p>But about two-thirds of the way through, there was an explicit, hardcore sex scene. And a few chapters later, there was another one—more abbreviated but no less hardcore. Not poorly written or ineffective, just shocking to me, the unprepared reader thinking this was basically <em>Hunger Games</em> with dragons.</p>
<p>Still a YA novel by genre, just aimed at not-so-YAs.</p>
<p>The fantasy world also gets routinely interrupted by Earth conventions like giving people the finger or naming the months &ldquo;October&rdquo;, &ldquo;November&rdquo;, etc. What are the chances this fantasy society developed the same Latin-derived month names and insulting hand gestures?</p>
<p>Despite it all, the story is intriguing enough and the writing light enough for me to check out the sequel. 📚</p>

			 <p>In the rolls of the families that first returned to Judah from Babylon, Nehemiah lists &ldquo;the men of the other Nebo&rdquo; (v33) and &ldquo;the sons of the other Elam&rdquo; (v34).</p>
<p>The weird part is that there is no first Nebo or first Elam in Nehemiah.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a nearly identical list in Ezra 2 that sheds a <em>little</em> bit of light, but raises its own question.</p>
<p>Ezra 2:7 refers to &ldquo;the sons of Elam&rdquo; and numbers them 1,254. Then Ezra 2:31 refers to &ldquo;the sons of the other Elam&rdquo; and numbers them&hellip; 1,254.</p>
<p>Ezra 2 refers to only one Nebo and counts merely, &ldquo;the sons of Nebo&rdquo; (v29).</p>
<p>First, what happened? How many Elams were there? How many Nebos? Did the two Elams really have the same number of enrolled descendants? What happened to the first Elam and the first Nebo between Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7?</p>
<p>Second, how would it feel to be the family of &ldquo;the other Nebo&rdquo;—especially when the first Nebo is nowhere to be found?</p>

			 <p>Meera and I were talking about the definition of ska on the last trip to the lake, and today I randomly had a brief clip of a Mighty Mighty Bosstones song jump into my head.</p>
<p>I couldn’t quite place it, but I searched my library for likely songs and came up with “<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/you-gotta-go/1631010761?i=1631010764">You Gotta Go</a>” from 2002.</p>
<p>Turns out it was exactly the opposite: “<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/whered-you-go/321136667?i=321136917">Where’d You Go</a>” from 1991.</p>

<p>Nehemiah could not have known how spectacularly God would answer his prayer. The good he did is remembered in his own words throughout time and around the world.</p>
<p>To be fair, this undying remembrance is not “for his good,” but it is for ours, and we glorify God because of Nehemiah, so perhaps it is for his good after all.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/1548271101">2k to 10k</a> by Rachel Aaron.</p>
<p>Picked this up off a Reddit thread. Good thing it was cheap, because it contains little advice a thinking writer doesn’t know (you should do some planning before you start writing!), and it needs editing very badly. Ironically, it has a chapter on editing and an acknowledgment of the editor of the <em>second edition</em>.</p>
<p>This author is successfully published in fantasy and sci-fi; I hope those books are much better-written than this one.</p>

			 <p>Finished watching: <em>Alien: Romulus</em>. I&rsquo;m not exactly a huge fan of the <em>Alien</em> franchise, but neither was this a particularly good installment. Parts of it were beautifully done, but most of it was unmotivated horror.</p>

<p>The inside is apparently some sort of digital art museum and cultural archive, but Meera and I didn’t have the time or the energy to tour it in between chocolate and beer tastings while we were in Brussels (July 2024). We almost always enjoy a good museum, but we really didn’t want to spend another day walking around inside when the outside looked like it did in the picture.</p>
<p>So we took the metro out there, observed a super-cool building, then took the metro right back to Grand Place and sat down for a drink and a snack.</p>

			 <p>I converted <a href="https://jerrytowler.com">my microblog</a> to be my primary home page.</p>
<p>First, I converted my microblog to the Alpine theme. I love the aesthetics of the <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/18">Tufte theme</a> (<a href="https://github.com/pimoore/microdotblog-tufte">GitHub</a>) I was using by <a href="https://micro.blog/pimoore">@pimoore</a>, but it hasn&rsquo;t been updated in a while and Micro.blog has been adding features rapidly.</p>
<p>I briefly flirted with <a href="https://micro.blog/mtt">@mtt</a>’s <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/96">Tiny Theme</a> for its flexibility, but I like the out-of-the-box behavior of Alpine better.</p>
<p>But if it was going to be my home page, I wanted it to be a little richer. <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.manton.org">home page</a> is quite stark, which is probably what he wants: it drastically centers the microblog.</p>
<p>But I wanted more.</p>
<p>So I dug into the theme and made a few changes: I added a second column for photos posts (based on a category)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, which meant I had to add a little more space. By default, the column of posts is only <code>700px</code> wide; mine is <code>55em</code> wide.</p>
<p>The attached picture is my previous home page, made using Jekyll’s Compass theme, for posterity.</p>

<p>I was worried this would be another summer “comedy” that would leave me cringing, but it was actually a fun, fast-paced comedy/heist with a good performance by Scarlett Johansson, a hilarious Woody Harrelson in his element, Ray Romano doing work I didn’t know he could do, a fun cameo by Colin Jost, and a totally useless Channing Tatum with too much makeup.</p>
<p>Several excellent laughs, lots of fun, and the space race! Absolutely recommended.🍿</p>

<p>This morning, I was leaving Luxembourg City to visit Vianden Castle (still <em>en route</em>) and asked how to buy a ticket out here, since it’s half an hour of train and half an hour of bus and mostly outside the city. A kind employee gently told me, no ticket needed.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780374715243">Four Thousand Weeks</a> by Oliver Burkeman.</p>
<p>A critical reminder that being the kind of person you feel you ought to be is impossible, and that’s okay—perhaps even freeing, when considered rightly.</p>
<p>Burkeman spends a lot of time repeating himself, but perhaps that’s part of the point: by repeatedly learning another way in which we can never “spend” time optimally, he maybe hopes to get just one ounce of understanding through.</p>
<p>That said, I found the nihilism offputting, even though I suspect he would argue that it’s not nihilism but realism.

<p>What a spectacular book for post-pandemic white-collar knowledge work. Partly philosophical and partly actionable, Newport says maybe we should step back from the cliff of minute-to-minute “pseudo-productivity” and consider the contribution of our entire lives or careers.</p>
<p>The hardest part for me is that I recognize everything he says in my workplace but I’m concerned about how radical even the lightweight suggestions he gives would be. I guess that’s an indication I should start implementing.

<p>This world of forgotten gods where prayer and worship actually affect their powers continues to fascinate me, but unfortunately the writing doesn’t measure up to the story.

<p>Apparently Sanderson’s fiftieth novel, and the last of the four Kickstarter books. Directly impacts the Cosmere, and the first of these weird ones where having read <em>everything</em> Cosmere really helps enrich the story.</p>
<p>A swashbuckling adventure—seriously. But of course with magic and mystery you expect.</p>
<p>My only complaint is that so much of the mystery of the early books is gone—we know so much now about Investiture and such that I’m no longer dazzled by it.</p>

			 <p>I discovered <a href="https://micro.blog/lex">@lex</a>‘s <a href="https://lexfriedman.com/connections/">Conlextions</a> puzzles through <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/">Dr. Drang</a> at the end of December and immediately ripped through the archives. It has just now occurred to me I can post results here.</p>
<p>Obviously, I will cherry-pick the good ones where I made no mistakes.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781645241188">The Law</a> by Jim Butcher.</p>
<p>A fairly weak entry in the series, maybe intended as a palate cleanser after <em>Battle Ground</em>. We see a little of Dresden’s psyche, but not much. A short return to the early novels’ PI theme, but with Dresden as a far more powerful, and more broken, wizard. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781797204550">Heroes</a> by Stephen Fry.</p>
<p>A fantastic addition to <em>Mythos</em>. Fry picks some of the best-known Greek heros (and one not-so-well-known) and brings them and their complete stories to life. He tells complete stories, bringing in all the crazy background and mythological history and real history. You get modern geography and philosophy and demography alongside Theseus and Perseus.</p>
<p>I have no nits to pick, except that again the audiobook, while delivered excellently by Fry himself, is mastered poorly, so keep your volume knob handy. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781405934138">Mythos</a> by Stephen Fry.</p>
<p>Excellent retelling of the classic Greek myths. Plus some I’ve never heard. If you ever read (or refused to read) Edith Hamilton’s <em>Mythology</em>, you owe it to yourself to read this one. Fry brings the characters and stories to dramatic life, truly retelling rather than just reciting.</p>
<p>The audiobook was absolutely worth it—Stephen Fry reads it himself and is engaging and hilarious as always—although the dynamic range is incredibly high, so be careful with your volume. 📚</p>

<p>The day after Christmas for us is always a chance to get outside. December 23 is often a travel day; Christmas Eve is full of cooking and wrapping and worship; and Christmas is full of eating and unwrapping and family. At that point, everybody needs a break and some fresh air.</p>

			 <p>In September 2021, we spent a couple of days in Barcelona on our way back from Minorca and Mallorca. We had read that a favorite local breakfast spot was <a href="https://americansinbarcelona.com/granja-viader/">Granja M. Viader</a>. Usually, that means there’s a line of tourists out the door, and Meera and I are almost always unwilling to wait in a line like that.</p>

<p>However, this day, the line was practically nonexistent (probably because tourists hadn’t yet come back after COVID), and we slipped in for a breakfast of hot chocolate and churros.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1214/2023/d0465226d8.jpg" width="600" height="522" alt="A cup of hot chocolate, churros, and other pastries I can’t name.">
<p>Two things stood out from this visit:</p>
<ol>
<li>The hot chocolate was in fact thick warmed chocolate to dip the churros in. Those familiar with Spanish or Mexican culture are rolling their eyes, but this treat was new to me.</li>
<li>This restaurant has been serving this food for <strong>150 years</strong>. Incredible longevity for a breakfast spot.</li>
</ol>
<p>When we travel, I’m always torn between visiting the famous spots and being too much of a tourist. In this case, we threaded the needle perfectly and got an amazing unexpected breakfast. ✈️ 🗺️ 🇪🇸</p>

			 <p>Flying west across the international date line always screws with my “streaks.” Games, fitness—anything that automatically tracks daily continuity breaks.</p>
<p>All of these apps need to build in grace days. Either occasional true penalty-free skip days or, like <a href="https://playknotwords.com/">Knotwords</a>, ways to rebuild the streak.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of a conversation in the Apple sphere a few years ago about preserving fitness streaks on rest days or across the Sabbath for observant Jews. Did that ever get addressed?</p>
<p>Shawn Blanc offered <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/2019/11/how-to-have-a-recovery-day-with-the-apple-watch/">a solution</a>, and here’s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gentler-streak-activity-rest/id1576857102">a fitness app</a> with a graceful (they call it “self-compassionate”) third-party approach, but first-party apps should really support this kind of thing too.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780765389138">The Kaiju Preservation Society</a> by John Scalzi. Fun, quick romp through a particular many-worlds hypothesis. A little too cute in places, and far too embedded in the real-world time (including soon-to-be-obscure Trump jokes), but a very enjoyable read. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finally in our hotel in Melbourne. Quick recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>At 2pm Friday everything was fine.</li>
<li>At 3pm Friday our Melbourne flight was delayed two hours, but our Dallas flight was delayed <em>four</em> hours, so we would miss our connection, and the next DFW-MEL flight didn’t leave for two more days.</li>
<li>American couldn’t rebook us despite my platinum status. Our travel department figured out how to get us there through LAX, but before that a colleague traveling with us with Concierge Key status got us not only rebooked but on standby with a third alternative (which we ended up taking). If only American cared that much about all its passengers.</li>
<li>We made DFW, but all the gates were occupied, so we sat on the tarmac until one cleared up.</li>
<li>After getting into the airport, we closed down the Flagship Lounge (it inexplicably closes at 10:15pm even though the last flight boards much later), enjoying champagne, beers, cocktails, and even some dinner while we waited.</li>
<li>Our Melbourne flight was late arriving, so it was very late boarding, and we didn’t take off until 12:30am or later.</li>
<li>Seventeen and a half hours later, we landed in Melbourne around 7:30am.</li>
<li>Obviously we were too early to check in, so we dropped our bags at the hotel, got coffee and breakfast, and went exploring at the river, botanical gardens, and CBD.</li>
<li>We returned to the hotel for a break before venturing back out for dinner.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s been quite a ridiculous 34 hours, but we are excited to be here. Now for that nap…</p>

			 <p>In November 2021, Meera and I were itching to get traveling again. We had had our shots, waited past all the international quarantines, and it was time to go again.</p>
<p>We chose to visit Minorca and Mallorca because we had enjoyed Barcelona so much a few years prior, and we wanted to go back but experience something new.</p>

<p>While we stayed in Sóller for our time on Mallorca, one of our favorite days was driving up the coast to Port d’Andratx to visit the lighthouses and see the sailboats at the port.</p>
<p>The wealthy neighborhoods didn’t make it easy, but we did manage to park the car and do some hiking on the hills overlooking the port before going down for dinner and a closer look.</p>

<p>We were lucky enough to catch a class of sailors out training, and they kindly passed in front of the lighthouse like ducklings following their mother so I could catch this photo from the docks. ✈️⛵️🇪🇸</p>

			 <p>I really hate that the best experience of micro.blog is on the web. The Mac app is flaky uploading photos, and while you can write alt text, there&rsquo;s no way to position them in the post. The iOS apps don&rsquo;t really believe in the share sheet (sharing to Sunlit loses my post 100% of the time), and scrolling in the official micro.blog app routinely breaks, making scrolling to the bottom of the post to continue writing impossible. I&rsquo;d switch to Drafts, but I still need to handle photo uploading. (To be fair, Epilogue continues to be awesome, and I&rsquo;ve never tried Wavelength.)</p>

			 <p>In June 2013, I was on a business trip to Mountain View. I had never been to California before, so I spent as much of my free time exploring as I could.</p>
<p>I drove down to Santa Cruz, and I saw the Breakwater Lighthouse.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1214/2023/6768ada19a.jpg" width="600" height="448" alt="A traditional white lighthouse with green trim on the end of a rocky breakwater curving to the left. The lighthouse has no house, just a door. A person stands on the jacks-shaped cement forms at the end of the breakwater.">
<p>Then I went west to Pigeon Point Light Station near Pescadero.</p>

An empty bench looks out onto the ocean, while an empty sand parking lot and overcast sky complete the gloomy picture.">
<p>But despite my love of lighthouses, the vast majority of the photos I took that week—with my disappointing-in-retrospect iPhone 4 camera—were from the San Jose Municipal Rose Garden, which is a thing that exists. Some of them even turned out pretty good!</p>

<p>You’re not permitted to use local “found” firewood, so one of the people with us brought a truck bed full of huge branches we spent a long time chopping into firewood on which to cook a very nice pot of camp chili.</p>

			 <p>In August 2016, I was in Adelaide for a business trip. Okay, I was in Woomera for a business trip, but I had taken a week of vacation on the end of the trip to explore Adelaide.</p>
<p>One day I decided to hike up Mount Lofty. Okay, I decided to walk to Mount Lofty from Adelaide and then climb up it.</p>
<p>The trek took me past a place called Waterfall Gully, which is a… gully… with a waterfall. Australians have the best names: Mount Lofty, Waterfall Gully.</p>

<p>The hike up was quite challenging: 1,000m up in a 5,000m hike. But I kept getting passed by trailrunners getting their vertical 5k in. It was embarrassing. (It didn’t help that the only boots I had with me were steel-toe safety boots.)</p>
<p>After reaching the top, I tried to walk back to Adelaide, but I was exhausted, so I stopped for a pizza and called an Uber. ✈️ 🍕</p>

<p>In Zurich, we were unwilling to pay for a chocolate tour, so we found a review online that listed the places they went and did the tour on our own. One of the places was of course the Sprüngli shop, where we learned about Luxemburgerli, which are basically colorful mini-macarons.</p>

			 <p>In 2019, my wife and I joined another couple for <a href="https://savvyhedgehog.com/backpacking-colorados-san-juan-mountains/">a backpacking trip</a> in the San Juan Mountains of south-central Colorado. On the way back, we stopped for a day at my in-law’s condo in Ruidoso, New Mexico to recover a bit. But instead of resting and recuperating from a challenging hike, we decided to go for <em>another</em> hike in the nearby Lincoln National Forest.</p>
<p>Okay, this one is entirely my fault.</p>
<p>I thought, hey, without 30–40 pounds on our backs, how hard could it be?</p>
<p>But the day was hot and the trail had depressingly little shade, so halfway through, I snapped this picture of us in front of Grindstone Lake, and we turned around and went home.</p>

			 <p>I came across this March 2022 post about <a href="https://chrishannah.me/having-control-over-your-own-day/">having control over your day</a> by <a href="https://micro.blog/ChrisHannah">@ChrisHannah</a>, where they advocate for flexible working hours:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Personally, I think the best solution for people and companies (where the job allows), is if your entire working hours were flexible. For example, you could be contracted to work 8 hours a day, but you are free to fulfil those 8 hours between the hours of 7 am and 9 pm. Maybe one day you have plans later on in the day, so you choose to start at 7 am, and have a short lunch. But another day, you want to go have brunch with friends, so you could start later, or perhaps you just take a long break?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My employer has had for many years exactly such a model: we are expected to be &ldquo;online&rdquo;—that is, generally available and working, not necessarily actually logged into Teams—from 9am–3pm Monday–Friday, and we are expected to log 80 hours every two weeks (we&rsquo;re a research consultancy, so we take both &ldquo;log&rdquo; and &ldquo;80 hours&rdquo; both seriously and literally). We&rsquo;re also expected to &ldquo;work from site&rdquo; Tuesday–Thursday, with Mondays and Fridays being optional work-from-home days. Beyond those constraints, we&rsquo;re free to flex our schedule in the way that lets us do our best work.</p>
<p>As a manager, I often field questions about why our policies are not even <em>more</em> flexible, and even I think of us as stuck in the past in many ways. So I appreciated seeing a proposal for improvement that we have already engaged, suggesting that perhaps things are not always better everywhere else.</p>

			 <p>Achievement unlocked: snow skiing 🎿 in August. To be fair, we cheated by flying to Chile 🇨🇱 to do it.</p>
<p>It’s also many other firsts:</p>
<ul>
<li>first ski trip in the southern hemisphere</li>
<li>first trip to Chile</li>
<li>first trip to South America</li>
<li>first trip to the southern hemisphere with my wife (we’ve both been, repeatedly, separately, to Australia)</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, it’s the fourth continent I’ve skied on (North America, Europe, and Asia were my first three).</p>

			 <p>Since the ongoing implosion of X, née Twitter, began, I’ve been combing through my archive of 15,000-ish tweets across 15 years since April 20, 2008.</p>
<p>It’s the longest record of anything in my life, stretching back further than my oldest Day One entry<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I remember almost all of it. Sometimes that’s good: starting in 2017, I published almost 90,000 words of Bible analysis to Twitter. Sometimes that’s bad: I spent a lot of days over the years angry about American politics—left and right—screaming impotently into the void instead of building something valuable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to change that; moving here is helping. I find that here I write with more intentionality. The sense of presence, permanence, and possession encourages me to think more—not too much more, I hope—before hitting &ldquo;Post.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781628240115">Thirty Questions</a> by Timothy C. Tennent. Structured like a catechism but with answers far too long to memorize. Not a bad introduction to Christian doctrine, but fits better as a study: Tennent clearly expects you to do some of the work on your own. Fortunately, he gives chapter-and-verse starting points. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780281079650">The One Hour Bible</a> by SPCK. Edited by Philip Law. A great idea—not paraphrasing or summarizing but eliding: using the actual words of the New Living Translation to tell the story of God in fewer words.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while this treatment works well for the Old Testament and most of the Gospels, they abridge Acts too much, and the rest of the New Testament disappears until Revelation 22. I know it doesn’t fit the format, but ironically one of the elided verses (2 Timothy 3:16) says, “<em>all</em> Scripture is useful.” 📚</p>

			 <p>We have tried a bunch of non-alcoholic (n/a) beers lately, looking for something that satisfies the desire for something bubbly and refreshing but doesn&rsquo;t have the associated buzz, drowsiness, lack of focus, terrible sleep, and other downsides of the high-ABV beverages we&rsquo;ve come to enjoy.</p>
<p>This is an unordered list of the ones we&rsquo;ve tried with comments where applicable. All drinks with the same name as alcoholic beers are the non-alcoholic versions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://athleticbrewing.com">Athletic</a> - has a ton of different flavors, most of them very expensive (&gt;$2/drink on their website); we&rsquo;ve only tried the beers, not the seltzers
<ul>
<li>Upside Dawn - a golden ale that has nothing to do with golden ale, but is tasty nonetheless; my wife&rsquo;s favorite n/a beer</li>
<li>Cerveza Atletica - my wife&rsquo;s second-favorite n/a beer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brooklyn Brewery <a href="https://brooklynbrewery.com/brooklyn-beers/non-alcoholic/special-effects-variety-pack/">Special Effects</a>
<ul>
<li>Hoppy Amber - not on the top of my list for n/a beers, but comes in the variety pack, so what are you going to do?</li>
<li>IPA - a little bit thicker than a real IPA would be, but without the bite of alcohol to balance it out</li>
<li>Pils - I don&rsquo;t love alcoholic pils, so I&rsquo;m not to be trusted, but it&rsquo;s just as crisp and satisfying after a day in the woods (or the yard)</li>
<li>Hazy IPA - delicious; as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, nearly a complete beer substitute—as long as you only like one flavor of IPA, because this is the only one I&rsquo;ve found that&rsquo;s this good</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deschutes <a href="https://www.deschutesbrewery.com/beer/na-black-butte-/">Black Butte Porter</a> - different from the real thing, but delicious.</li>
<li>Sierra Nevada <a href="https://sierranevada.com/brews/hop-splash/">Hop Splash</a> &ldquo;hop water&rdquo; - a weird beverage that reminds you of beer but clearly isn&rsquo;t trying to actually be beer; recommended despite my use of the word &ldquo;weird&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="drinks-that-have-been-suggested-to-us-but-which-we-havent-tried-yet">Drinks that have been suggested to us, but which we haven&rsquo;t tried yet</h2>
<ul>
<li>Independence Brewing <a href="https://checkout.independencebrewing.com/products/kaw-hop-water-6-pack">KAW! Sparkling Hop Water</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.asahiinternational.com/stories/innovation/asahi-00-launch/">Asahi Super Dry 0.0</a> - <a href="https://www.macpsy.ch/2023/07/18/relaxing-with-an.html">recommended</a> by <a href="https://www.macpsy.ch">@TheMacPsych</a></li>
<li><a href="https://us.erdinger.de/beer/non-alcoholic.html">Erdinger Non-Alcoholic</a> - also <a href="https://micro.blog/TheMacPsych/21076988">recommended</a> by <a href="https://micro.blog/TheMacPsych">@TheMacPsych</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.heineken.com/us/en/our-beers/heineken-0-0">Heineken 0.0</a> - recommended by seemingly every ad on every Formula 1 track for the last few years</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cruxfermentation.com/beer/">crux fermentation project</a> - recommended by <a href="https://micro.blog/jean">@jean</a>, specifically the No-Mo Hazy</li>
</ul>
<p>We still love great beers and ciders, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll see us at <a href="https://thedooryardsa.com">The Dooryard</a> this weekend, but this kind of variety is a wonderful change from the previous alcohol-or-nothing regime.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780310113188">For the Body</a> by Timothy C. Tennent. A critical exposition of the need for the modern church to develop and espouse a positive theology of the body rather than the decades of pure negative theology: “don’t do that; that’s wrong.”</p>
<p>A great starter book on the topic, although the last two chapters are aimed squarely at pastors, not laypeople (they still have value, but not as much).</p>
<p>My primary takeaway is that developing a positive, holistic theology of the body allows us to see our sexuality, our bodies, and ourselves in the context of the complete gospel, not by the light of a few specific verses that mostly just make people angry regardless of what they believe. 📚</p>

			 <p>Back in 2014, there was a Twitter account, or maybe a Tumblr account, that published pop songs as sonnets<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I loved the spin on genre, but I noticed that they were all Petrarchan (Italian) sonnets, which go ABBA ABBA CDE CDE, or Shakespearean (English) sonnets, which go ABAB CDCD EFEF GG.</p>
<p>I complained on Twitter that we needed Spenserian ones, which have a harder rhyme scheme: ABAB BCBC CDCD EE. But you shouldn&rsquo;t complain without offering a solution, so I give you my offering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tho' oft my speech ere uttering seem mad,<br>
Fair Helios signals end of labor&rsquo;s reign<br>
O&rsquo;er you and I, who, lightened, upward gad&mdash;<br>
Ascend beyond the heav&rsquo;ns' celestial plane<br>
Lo, trumpets sound our doom, and promise pain:<br>
Your harbinger I welcome, arms ope&rsquo;d wide<br>
For I, clothèd in joy, will be not slain<br>
Let not your countenance be hurt, nor pride<br>
Know I, and I alone, yield to no tide<br>
No force of earth, nor beast, nor god could quell<br>
The rise and rise unstoppable inside<br>
Of happiness whose bounds no man can tell<br>
&mdash;Now strike! your hands together, join the din<br>
A roofless room, a bonafide boon, within.</p>

<p>After getting effectively to the current endgame (there&rsquo;s no real end, but at some point there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;next upgrade&rdquo;), it occurred to me that the simplicity of the game was ideal for me to try learning Swift again.</p>
<p>I dove all the way into Swift and SwiftUI, first using <a href="https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/">Swift Playgrounds</a> and then Xcode directly. It&rsquo;s amazing how quickly a simple app can come together using all these tools and the crazy-fast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> that is Playgrounds.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video of the first level as of today.</p>

			 <p>I just accidentally used the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212757">Universal Control</a> feature built into macOS Ventura. I had set up my work MacBook Pro next to the monitor for my personal Mac mini, where I used to keep my laptop when it was connected to this monitor. So I naturally just hauled the cursor beyond the side of the screen, and it <em>magically</em> kept going onto the laptop screen!</p>
<p>It took me several seconds to figure out that something special had happened and that my cursor had jumped from one machine to the other.</p>
<p>Something weird: how did it know which side of my monitor the laptop was on? It could guess by choosing the direction you try to move your cursor, exactly like I did, but it&rsquo;s still absolutely delightful.</p>

<p>The white iPod (3rd gen, I think) was a birthday present when I turned 17 or 18; the iPods Touch tided me over until Verizon got the iPhone, and that iPhone 5s is still the best design ever made.</p>

			 <p>Today I discovered Merlin Mann&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom">Wisdom Project</a>, and it&rsquo;s the kind of thing at least part of my Micro.blog should aspire to be.</p>
<p>Little snippets that are helpful to me now and might be helpful to me or others later.</p>
<p>Some of them are very #wisdom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like it or not, you&rsquo;re always practicing something. Put another way, whichever muscle you exercise the most can&rsquo;t help but strengthen. Often to the detriment of others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And some are pure Merlin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your calendar represents a portfolio of promises to your future self. Treat it that way.</p>

			 <p>Our other early-COVID desk, set up not in the office but the guest bedroom. Like everyone else, my wife and I spent too much time on videoconferences to sit in the same room, so we were fortunate to have space to spread out like this. Same monitor, different laptop and stand. No K’nex.</p>

			 <p>Standing desk evolution, a few weeks in COVID. At this point, we still had the blinds open to remind us what “outside” looked like. It still kind of felt like vacation, not yet like the terrifying pandemic it turned out to be. (It did, and still does, make me wish I were indie.)</p>

			 <p>Cleaning out and backing up my college/grad school MacBook Pro (15-inch Early 2008), and the nostalgia is strong in this one.</p>
<p>Sure, its 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo isn’t that impressive, and neither is its 4GB of DDR2 or 256GB GeForce 8600M, but it is weirdly performant on OS X 10.8.3, and the aesthetic is arguably more beautiful and indisputably more fun than current macOS.</p>
<p>The old-school 3D icons for Twitter, TextWrangler, and others are elegant, and maybe we should go back to them.</p>
<p>I did all of grad school on this computer, including tons of Matlab and hundreds of pages of LaTeX, and it’s kind of sad to see it go.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781473200180">Guards! Guards!</a> by Terry Pratchett. Probably my least favorite of the series so far. So many moving parts, and the jokes didn’t land for me. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781473215290">The Lost Metal</a> by Brandon Sanderson. I absolutely tore through this book. As usual, Sanderson’s organization awes me, although I couldn’t help but feel he tossed a little too much Cosmere lore at us in one book to prepare us for what’s coming. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593359570">Empire of Ivory</a> by Naomi Novik. More like a log of adventure than a novel. Temeraire and Laurence finally have a hard decision to make, although their expressed value system removes the tension entirely for the reader. Still a fun adventure though. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593359556">Throne of Jade</a> by Naomi Novik. Seemingly totally independent from the first novel except the characters, another exploration into a world where dragons are rare but natural. The pacing is again weird, but the world entertaining enough to make up for it. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593359549">His Majesty&rsquo;s Dragon</a> by Naomi Novik. Learning a new world is always fun, and Novik launches in as if England and France have always used dragon fleets in their wars. The climax is too long in coming though, and too short; similarly, the denouement is precipitous. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780062225733">Wyrd Sisters</a> by Terry Pratchett. The first Discworld novel that actually made me laugh out loud. The Discworld is the same glorious place, but the words—powerful things—tickled me just right. I suspect I missed a lot more literature references than I got. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781101885949">The Bear and the Nightingale</a> by Katherine Arden. Takes a long time to get going, but spellbinding once there.

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780613572781">Sourcery</a> by Terry Pratchett. The self-consistency of Discworld, despite the total lack of logic, amazes me every time. All of its legends and myths and prophecies are true, just never in ways the reader expects, yet somehow always in ways that blend comfortably with the overall chaos. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780552166621">Mort</a> by Terry Pratchett. Death hires an apprentice so he can take some time off and experience life, and maybe find a husband for his daughter. All of those things happen, but as is common on Discworld, not exactly in the expected fashion. Rincewind cameo. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780804179041">Uprooted</a> by Naomi Novik. Starts as a twist on a fairy tale, ends as high fantasy. The finale is a bit more chaotic than you’d wish, but the whole thing is a good time. 95% for children, but very much meant for grown-ups. 📚</p>
