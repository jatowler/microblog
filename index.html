			 <p>Just published this weekend&rsquo;s project, an <a href="https://versenotes.org/bible-reading-plan-generator/">automatic Bible reading plan generator</a> for VerseNotes.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Select length of plan (e.g., 90 days, 1 year) or daily reading time (15 minutes/day)</li>
<li>Select what to read (whole Bible, OT, NT, Gospels)</li>
<li>Select whether to read straight through or get a mix of OT/NT/Gospels/Psalms each day</li>
<li>Select grace days per week or per month (free days to catch up or to reflect if you&rsquo;re already caught up)</li>
<li>Select starting date</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve built the plan you like, you can print it out easily or bookmark it/share it with others using the Copy Link button.</p>
<h2 id="build-note">Build Note</h2>
<p>The piece I&rsquo;m proudest of is the dynamic update of what you&rsquo;re getting yourself into. As you change parameters, you get an instant calculation of how long you need to read each day OR how many days it&rsquo;ll take to finish your plan.</p>
<p><a href="https://versenotes.org/bible-reading-plan-generator/">Check it out</a> and let me know what you think!</p>

			 <p>A fun toy I built over the weekend: <a href="https://versenotes.org/verse-clock/">Verse Clock</a>.</p>
<p>A reader asked whether you could use <a href="https://versenotes.org/a-list-of-books-in-the-bible-by-number-of-chapters/">my table of chapters, verses, and words</a> to come up with a verse for every minute of the day (e.g., John 3:16 for 3:16pm), so I spent a few hours coding it up and voilà, a verse for every minute (well, 1,355 of them; there are 85 hour-minute combinations that cannot be mapped to a chapter-verse in any book).</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like the displayed verse, just click &ldquo;Current Time&rdquo; again to get a new one, or just wait a minute—it&rsquo;s a functional clock you can leave open if you want. You can even switch between 12-hour and 24-hour time.</p>
<p>Finally, you get a link to the whole chapter so you can read the verse in context, and if I have <a href="https://versenotes.org/chapter-by-chapter/">chapter notes</a> available for the book, you&rsquo;ll get a link to them.</p>
<p>This was a fun and quick tool to build; I&rsquo;m looking forward to the next one.</p>

			 <p><em>My sister, aptly blogging at <a href="https://micro.blog/QuilledSister">@QuilledSister</a>, writes short stories <a href="https://thequilledsister.blog">on her blog</a>. Read her stories! She is a good fiction writer. I am not. But sometimes I get inspired to write a response. This is one of them.</em></p>
<p><strong>Original Story</strong>: <a href="https://thequilledsister.blog/2024/08/04/today-i-am-fatigue/">Fatigue</a></p>
<h2 id="my-story">My Story</h2>
<p>She was old, these days. Not that you’d know it to look at her. Fewer did, too, these days, but she supposed that was to be expected. It wasn’t the streak of gray she kept carefully hidden out of respect for the bartender, who was still denying the existence of hers. It wasn’t the remnants of a bright pink applied in a fit of misdirected youthful energy—not hers, this time; that waitress had been removed the next day, along with as much of the pink as she could.</p>
<p>No, fewer people looked at her because fewer people looked for her. Didn’t they know what she could do? How she had stocked everything just so, using local ingredients wherever she could, but sending out across the world if she ran out of options. How she had brought in only the very best bartenders, the ones who understood what she was trying to do here? The ones who didn’t question when the six-foot-nine thug got a peach mangonada, the alluring goth chick got a single finger of whiskey (neat, but always slightly pine-flavored) for the third time this month, or the Clint Eastwood wannabe got—well, he got a finger of whiskey, too, but without the pine.</p>
<p>Ms. Harliot poured another drink, a tea for a man in a black bowler who could have been from the 1920s or the 2020s, a tea with perhaps a little too much matcha for a true connoisseur, but which he would only remember as delicious. The O’Harliots—they lost the O in those same 1920s when Ellis Island would let the Irish into the country but New York wouldn’t welcome them any further—had always been her favorite bartenders, even back to the first grandame O’Harliot who carted her around by hand before she had found a permanent home. No cockles or mussels, but they all got what they needed.</p>
<p>Every couple of decades she tried out another family, someone promising, someone who had been in before, maybe a few times. They’d last somewhere between a few hours and a few years, and then she’d find herself reaching out to another Harliot cousin who inexplicably found themselves staring at the labels above the bar, realizing that if they just mixed a little of <em>this</em> with a drop of <em>that</em>, the lanky boy who’d been staring into the middle distance since he took a seat against the wall an hour ago would feel a little better when he left.</p>
<p>They all felt a little better when they left. (Most of them felt better on their way up to the bar.) A little lighter. A little… like maybe that weight wasn’t quite so heavy today. Almost as if the emotional gravity in here were a little weaker than it had been on the doorstep.</p>
<p>As he left, the thug almost forgot he was carrying—almost forgot why he was carrying.</p>
<p>As she walked out, the woman with lustrous black hair, a bit too much eyeliner, way too much (or maybe too little) leather, and skin a whiter shade of pale didn’t think of those girls once. Or those guys. She thought about a bass guitar and the boy who played it.</p>
<p>As he retreated, the man with the painstakingly manicured five-o’clock shadow didn’t think the word “emasculated” once.</p>
<p>The awkwardly tall boy had left years ago, trench coat waving in the wind, a bit worse for wear but looking forward to graduation for the first time in his life.</p>
<p>She could do this forever. She’d been doing it for years, and she’d keep it up until she couldn’t any more. She could feel Christina—sorry, Ms. Harliot—feeling her age, feeling the world, but she could also feel a man who had just turned up her street, fuming about his ex, his lawyer, his ex’s lawyer, the judge, the clerk, and every happy man, woman, and child he’d seen in the last three weeks…</p>
<p>The Grudgery was old, these days. Not that you’d know it to look at her. But the people who needed her found her, looked at her, looked again, stepped across the threshold, and, invariably, felt a little lighter.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781250236227">A Psalm for the Wild-Built (Monk &amp; Robot Book 1)</a> by Becky Chambers.</p>
<p>This is the first book on my #TheologyOfRobotics reading list, which is expanding rapidly. A great fiction exploration of planetary stewardship and the relationship between humans and robots. Definitely fantasy, not sci-fi.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the book is about purpose—having one, finding one, whether you need one, whether just <em>being</em> is enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite opinionated, as it paints a rosy picture of a post-industrial society that reached an unnamed cataclysm and had to convert the entire civilization to a state of greater harmony with nature. It doesn&rsquo;t mention any of the violent politics that would have inevitably arisen regarding any undertaking of that kind or magnitude, regardless of its necessity. The humans left alive are depicted as unfailingly virtuous. All this in a quest for answers about stewardship of resources, of place, of planet, of people. The main character begins as a gardener, moves to what passes for a therapist, and finally goes adventuring in search of purpose.</p>
<p>Interestingly for my study, it literally depicts a robot that has theology! The theology is presented as fact by both human and robot. But when you step back, it&rsquo;s not necessary that the robot be a robot for the story to work. The robot has abandoned everything that would otherwise differentiate it from humans: it has &ldquo;parents&rdquo;, it is not immortal, it does not really repair itself. It could easily be a human member of a remote tribe that happened to speak the local language, and I tihnk nothing would actually change. So&hellip; good questions, but not specific to robots, I think.</p>

<p>Previous record was SAT, where the flight technically started boarding before I got on the parking shuttle, but it ended up delayed, so it counts less.</p>

<h2 id="my-response">My Response</h2>
<p>It was always the same. A trudge down a clean, brightly-lit path, a longing gaze up at the dead thing as if it could somehow hold the warmth that the living thing once had.</p>
<p>People are weird that way, I’ve noticed. They have all these memories of something alive—a father, a sister, a lover, a dog—and yet instead of sifting the memories to find the love they believe has left, they look at dead things instead: drawings, statues, tapestries, as if somehow the pressed and dried trees or rocks or wool marked with crushed flowers and snails have some sort of meaning that their own spirits don’t.</p>
<p>At least this one can tell the difference. I watch them inspect a marble face that isn’t right and dim stony eyes that never held light, clearly comparing the vibrance of memory to the icon of legacy.</p>
<p>Should I tell them? They’ve believed so long they probably wouldn’t understand; that’s another thing I’ve learned about people. They get an idea in their heads, and then they make choices based on that idea, and then they make choices based on those choices, and soon it’s impossible for the idea to have been wrong. They call it “belief,” which I suppose is as good a name as any.</p>
<p>But I shall tell you, since this one seems lost in thought staring at that door again.</p>
<p>There was never a chosen human. Thousands of years of “prophecy” of a Chosen One from a people that believed they were just barely younger than the dust of the ground. There’s that belief again; would it matter if they had all been born just as the latest war was starting? Was it important that they be old?</p>
<p>(They are not old. I am old, although there are many who would laugh at my youth. But this isn’t about me.)</p>
<p>There is a land, they say, where the people climb up mountains for fun. Just to do it. And in this land is a particular mountain that is the tallest. And as if there is more to see at the top of the tallest mountain than there is in a cup of hot tea, these people climb it.</p>
<p>It turns out they’re quite bad at it. Their lungs are not adapted to the altitude, and their fur is too thin and light for the cold, and their legs are really meant for distance running, not mountain climbing. For one thing, their knees go the wrong way.</p>
<p>But there are some other people who live near the mountain, whose lungs and hair are adapted for the mountain (although their knees still go the wrong way). When they climb the mountain, these two groups always go together: the adventure-seekers and the locals.</p>
<p>When they get to the top, who has climbed the mountain?</p>
<p>The one who saw it as a triumph to be achieved? Or the companion who made it possible to accomplish? The latter would never have left their home without the former; the former would never have reached the top alive alone.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve told you this fable, and you are to them as I to you, what prophecy would you write of these opposites who go up in the cold? Light and dark, thin of hair and rich of mane, backward of knee and—seriously, if you want to climb a mountain, look at a goat. Which way do their legs bend?</p>
<p>Anyway, I wrote that prophecy, and I said there would be a Chosen One. And there was. But who is to say which was which? The one who is dead or the one who mourns the dead thing by staring at a rock?</p>
<p>Their lives cannot be pulled apart any more than the threads of the tapestries depicting them could be unwoven and the image still stand. Their prophecies are not just intertwined, they are the same.</p>
<p>But for some reason, this allegedly wise old culture decided in the unremembered past that there can be only one, and they believed it so hard that they made it come true.</p>
<p>Well, sort of. One is remembered, and one remembers.</p>
<p>Humans are weird that way.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize until the afterword that Paolini was only 21 when <em>Eldest</em> was published. What a masterwork for someone so young, and yet it explains some of the inelegance of plot elements and prose. I almost recognize some of the flaws from my own high school attempts at fiction (none of which, obviously, were published).</p>
<p>A fun continuance to the first book, this time with way too much <em>deus ex machina</em> and Marty Stu going on. But for what it is, an entertaining read.</p>

<p>The addition of David Weber got us even more Mary Sue/Marty Stu characteristics, but at least there’s some serious risk in this one, with some major players stuck in England under Charles II, Amsterdam under siege, and Scotland for reasons I don’t understand. Also a shooting war with the Americans’ fancy new weapons. It goes—well, some of column A, some of column B, lots of explosions.</p>
<p>Still, the story is wonderful if you can maintain incredible suspension of disbelief.</p>

<p>I almost don’t want to admit I read this book. But I did. The story is fascinating.</p>
<p>But the writing continues to be without expertise. Yarros forgets she’s writing fantasy, or she just didn’t build a big enough world, or something. And the main character, a special magical girl who really only had one flaw in the first place (some physical weakness), appears to have lost even that—or, more likely, Yarros forgot that too.</p>
<p>The dragons continue to be awesome.</p>

<p>After <em>Fourth Wing</em> I decided I should go back to an older and wiser dragon novel. And yep, it was fun! Less sex, but more more wisdom, and no hokey failures to remember the fantasy realm is not the modern US.</p>
<p>Can’t say it was the best novel I’ve ever read, and it’s got all the standard Lord of the Rings cliches about a young man with an older mentor who turns out to be phenomenally powerful (maybe that’s more Star Wars than LOTR), but I love the slow build to an epic battle, plus the weirdo side characters that keep popping up.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After my family and my job, the thing I spent the most brainpower thinking about in 2024 was <a href="https://versenotes.org">VerseNotes</a>, which I&rsquo;ve been writing since August 2018.</p>
<p>This year marked a huge turning point, as I published the very first <a href="https://store.versenotes.org">VerseNotes products</a> and made the very first dollar I&rsquo;ve ever made online, and then a few more. VerseNotes currently represents about 0.02% of our income.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first review what I did, then the results.</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote just <strong>3</strong> new articles, two in January and one in July. Total words: 3,938.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://versenotes.org/fishing-for-men-naming-the-disciples/">Fishing for Men: Naming Jesus&rsquo;s Disciples</a></li>
<li><a href="https://versenotes.org/fishing-for-men-calling-the-disciples/">Fishing for Men: Calling Jesus&rsquo;s Disciples</a></li>
<li><a href="https://versenotes.org/why-does-daniel-go-by-his-hebrew-name-but-his-friends-go-by-their-chaldean-names/">Why Does Daniel Go By His Hebrew Name, But His Friends Go By Their Chaldean Names?</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, I published 183 new chapter summaries in <a href="https://versenotes.org/chapter-by-chapter/">Chapter By Chapter</a>, including the end of Luke as well as all of John, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Acts, and Judges. Total words: 20,347.</li>
<li>I passed 1,000 email subscribers on December 29, just eking out the win at the end of the year, my third year in a row of more than doubling the list size. Total words: I don&rsquo;t know how to count words in emails in Kit.</li>
</ul>
<p>What were the consequences?</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique visits: 99,625 (up 201.5% from 2023)</li>
<li>Revenue: +∞%</li>
</ul>
<p>The most popular page continues to be a data dump of <a href="https://versenotes.org/a-list-of-books-in-the-bible-by-number-of-chapters/">A List of Books In the Bible By Number of Chapters</a>, which includes numbers of verses and words as well, as well as some superlatives. Its traffic increased by 170% from 2023.</p>
<p>The fastest-growing page, unsurprisingly, is the Chapter By Chapter main page, up 267% from 2023. Unsurprising because it got by far the most attention this year.</p>
<p>Along with <a href="https://jerrytowler.com/2025/01/04/review-health-and-fitness.html">physical health</a>, VerseNotes is one of my two themes for 2025. I&rsquo;m excited to see what happens.</p>

			 <p>2024 was (apparently) not a good year for physical fitness for me. We got in a lot of good skiing and one backpacking trip (to <a href="https://nps.gov/grte/index.htm">Grand Teton National Park</a>), but otherwise I apparently didn&rsquo;t do much to keep myself alive. This post is a bit embarassing to publish, unlike <a href="https://jerrytowler.com/2025/01/04/review-reading.html">the</a> <a href="https://jerrytowler.com/2025/01/04/review-finances.html">last</a> <a href="https://jerrytowler.com/2025/01/04/review-travel.html">three</a>, but I&rsquo;ll try to use that as motivation to do better.</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily active calories up 3.1% from 2023, but down 9.6% from 2022.</li>
<li>Daily average exercise minutes: 31, which is above my goal and <em>way</em> higher than 2023 (+29%), but remember that&rsquo;s an <em>average</em>. I only hit my goal 101 times in 2024. (So how did I average 31 minutes? Full days of skiing and hiking!)</li>
<li>Exercise
<ul>
<li>72.27 miles of walking (down 42.4% from 2023 and <em>58.9%</em> from 2022), although about half of these miles were done wearing a backpack with a 25-pound weight, so it&rsquo;s slightly more valuable walking.</li>
<li>37 yoga workouts (up from 20 in 2023 but down from 48 in 2022), although this included for the first time two outrageously hard aerial yoga sessions with Meera, which I&rsquo;d like to do more of.</li>
<li>27.39 miles of hiking (down 51.6% from 2023). The biggest difference here is that when we went to Ruidoso after Christmas last year, we went hiking every day; this year, we were just passing through on our way to Salt Lake City, and we did no hiking at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When I did Shawn Blanc&rsquo;s <a href="https://special.thefocuscourse.com/plan-your-year">Plan Your Year</a> exercise during <a href="https://jerrytowler.com/2024/12/10/took-a-few.html">our December retreat</a>, one of the two themes I came up with for 2025 was physical health, although I hadn&rsquo;t done this summary yet. Now that I have, I know I made a good choice.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s hard to talk about finances publicly, but it&rsquo;s an important part of an annual review. That said, as I wrote this post, I realized I wasn&rsquo;t comfortable talking about this publicly after all. But two parts I <em>am</em> comfortable with: investments and giving.</p>
<p><strong>Investments</strong>: We invested 8.1% more than 2023, excluding our maxed-out 403(b) contributions. I felt good about this number, because we also bought a car, which substantially ate into our ability to invest on our planned schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Giving</strong>: We gave 16.7% more to charity than 2023, which now represents 5.1% of our gross income (up from 4.7% last year). (What do I think about that? On one hand, 5.1% is less than 10%, which makes me feel like we <em>ought</em> to do more; on the other, the tithe is an Old Testament concept, and Paul says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:7&amp;version=NIV">2 Corinthians 9:7</a> that we should give what we feel called to give. The absolute number of dollars is significant, and we can see it&rsquo;s not only growing but growing as a percentage of our income, so I&rsquo;m comfortable with it for now.)</p>

<p>I actually did less flying this year than last year, despite trips to Tokyo, Milan, and Luxembourg (via Paris). My totals for the last four years:</p>
<ul>
<li>2024: 65,054</li>
<li>2023: 91,050</li>
<li>2022: 62,332</li>
<li>2021: 32,503</li>
<li>2020: 17,874</li>
</ul>
<p>We also did a substantial amount of travel by car this year, almost entirely in December: we drove from Texas to Virginia and back for Christmas, then from Texas to New Mexico and up to Utah to our new home for the next three months.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780812988703">Rocket Men</a> by Robert Kurson</p>
<p>The success of Apollo 8 is one of the biggest achievements of American spaceflight, or possibly all human spaceflight. I love space stories, but I knew Apollo 11 and 13 far better than this one, so we listened to it on the way to Utah.</p>
<p>The story deserves a better author. This seems to be a theme with me recently: wishing that amazing stories had been told by better writers, or better editors maybe.</p>
<p>Kurson tells the story with excellence, but only most of the time. The weaving of biographies of the three crew members—Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders—along with their wives enlivened the whole adventure and added color to what was already an epic tale.</p>
<p>However, the author was obsessed with the possibilities of failure to the point of repeating them in many chapters; I think he recited the litany of possible SPS failure modes and their consequences at least three times, which fully pulled us out of the story. And the chapter on the insanity that was America in 1968 was interesting, but he didn&rsquo;t tie it to the story of Apollo 8 at all.</p>
<p>Finally, the book wouldn&rsquo;t end. It had about one too many chapters—once the injection back to Earth was complete, we didn&rsquo;t need any more spaceflight story—an epilogue that was far, far too long (necessary, just way too much of it), and end matter that also went on forever.</p>
<p>I recommend this book to anyone interested in the Apollo missions, but be ready to forgive some repetition and inelegance and repetition.</p>

<p>This story is so epic it deserves better treatment. Unfortunately, this narrative weaves in dozens of names and focuses on a few, almost exclusively black women and white men (with few exceptions, nobody else is even named).</p>
<p>It also wandered around the Civil Rights movement, but without a clear aim.</p>
<p>In the end, we were left with a thousand great story elements but no story. (The movie, however, is excellent.)</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780307279286">Say Nothing</a> by Patrick Radden Keefe.</p>
<p>Damn, what a book.</p>
<p>We follow a number of major characters in the Troubles of Northern Ireland from about 1968 to about 2016. I learned much more than I’ve ever known about this history.</p>
<p>The author vividly recounts individual stories so well that the book is basically an interleaved biography rather than a history. He explores anger and despair and confusion effectively. And the details are just amazing.</p>
<p>The only problem is that the book is only lightly structured, and there are so many characters that I was never sure where I was in the big picture of the book. There&rsquo;s a framing device of a murder investigation, but that device only gets us half or two thirds through the book (with almost no signposts in between) and we lose all sense of scale and direction.</p>
<p>Maybe the book is a deliberate metaphor for the conflict in this way, because we also have the issue that the author goes to great pains to say that the IRA were terrorists and then makes the IRA main characters tremendously sympathetic, while doing nothing to justify the British/loyalist view.</p>
<p>Finally, the Irish accent of the voice actor is beautiful, if sometimes incomprehensible, and greatly heightened my enjoyment of the book.</p>

			 <p>My primary desk for the last twenty years or so has been a door that I stained and added a fir border and collapsible legs. It gives me a huge workspace, and it reminds me of my grandfather, who helped me make it before I left for college. However, its surface is not perfectly even, so when I added a nice aluminum-frame mechanical keyboard a couple of weeks ago, the keyboard rocked.</p>
<p>Today it occurred to me to ask my wife for some help, and she suggested a piece of felt under one of the legs. I put the felt under the whole thing, and it worked perfectly. Plus it looks kind of cool against the coiled cable.</p>
<p>Yes, I know they make desk mats, but this solution was already sitting in our house.</p>

<p>These books are always recommended for folks who keep re-reading the Dresden novels because nothing compares.</p>
<p>Indeed, nothing compares. The feel is mostly the same—urban wizard who has a day job sucked into shenanigans with mind-numbingly powerful creatures and/or artifacts alongside an ingénue apprentice—but despite Butcher&rsquo;s ham-handed early novels, Jacka has work to do. I&rsquo;ll probably keep reading, because if Jacka&rsquo;s series improves at the rate Butcher did, it&rsquo;ll be spectactular soon enough.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781526634245">A Court of Thorns and Roses</a> by Sarah J. Maas</p>
<p>I read this book to try to understand why it’s so popular, and I failed. It has all the trappings of a rollicking fantasy: a poor girl from the north is kidnapped by an evil magical being from a land she kind of thought was a fairy tale, where she discovers that not only does the villain have a heart of gold, but he’s not actually a villain, he’s the good guy in his own struggle of good versus an evil she can’t even contemplate.</p>
<p>But she’s a thoroughly unlikable character who is somehow nonetheless a Mary Sue, and the writing is mediocre at best. I would encourage a high school girl who wrote like this, but this author&rsquo;s editor is clearly not interested in helping her out.</p>
<p>Not recommended for anybody. Go pick something by Naomi Novik instead.</p>

<p>What an absolute mess of a book. But it’s clearly fantasy for somebody, and the world is definitely interesting. A better author could tell some great stories in this universe; this author needed to simplify and tell one excellent story instead of trying to set up a thousand future plotlines.</p>

<p>Our flight to Charlotte left 20 minutes late and has now spent 25 minutes taxiing. So fun! ✈️</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781649374080">Fourth Wing</a> by Rebecca Yarros.</p>
<p>I went into this book thinking it was more YA fantasy. And it is! A special girl goes to school where her mom is in charge, and she learns she’s even <em>more</em> special than she thought! The small-town boy-next-door she grew up with turns out to be a giant jerk, and the dark, brooding, phenomenally attractive arch-enemy-with-a-heart-of-gold becomes the love of her life. And obviously they save the world together, or whatever.</p>
<p>But about two-thirds of the way through, there was an explicit, hardcore sex scene. And a few chapters later, there was another one—more abbreviated but no less hardcore. Not poorly written or ineffective, just shocking to me, the unprepared reader thinking this was basically <em>Hunger Games</em> with dragons.</p>
<p>Still a YA novel by genre, just aimed at not-so-YAs.</p>
<p>The fantasy world also gets routinely interrupted by Earth conventions like giving people the finger or naming the months &ldquo;October&rdquo;, &ldquo;November&rdquo;, etc. What are the chances this fantasy society developed the same Latin-derived month names and insulting hand gestures?</p>
<p>Despite it all, the story is intriguing enough and the writing light enough for me to check out the sequel. 📚</p>

<p>Super fun homage to the original. Keaton is surprisingly adept, Catherine O’Hara is just about perfect, and Jenna Ortega continues to do Jenna Ortega things.</p>

			 <p>In the rolls of the families that first returned to Judah from Babylon, Nehemiah lists &ldquo;the men of the other Nebo&rdquo; (v33) and &ldquo;the sons of the other Elam&rdquo; (v34).</p>
<p>The weird part is that there is no first Nebo or first Elam in Nehemiah.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a nearly identical list in Ezra 2 that sheds a <em>little</em> bit of light, but raises its own question.</p>
<p>Ezra 2:7 refers to &ldquo;the sons of Elam&rdquo; and numbers them 1,254. Then Ezra 2:31 refers to &ldquo;the sons of the other Elam&rdquo; and numbers them&hellip; 1,254.</p>
<p>Ezra 2 refers to only one Nebo and counts merely, &ldquo;the sons of Nebo&rdquo; (v29).</p>
<p>First, what happened? How many Elams were there? How many Nebos? Did the two Elams really have the same number of enrolled descendants? What happened to the first Elam and the first Nebo between Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7?</p>
<p>Second, how would it feel to be the family of &ldquo;the other Nebo&rdquo;—especially when the first Nebo is nowhere to be found?</p>

			 <p>Meera and I were talking about the definition of ska on the last trip to the lake, and today I randomly had a brief clip of a Mighty Mighty Bosstones song jump into my head.</p>
<p>I couldn’t quite place it, but I searched my library for likely songs and came up with “<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/you-gotta-go/1631010761?i=1631010764">You Gotta Go</a>” from 2002.</p>
<p>Turns out it was exactly the opposite: “<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/whered-you-go/321136667?i=321136917">Where’d You Go</a>” from 1991.</p>

<p>Nehemiah could not have known how spectacularly God would answer his prayer. The good he did is remembered in his own words throughout time and around the world.</p>
<p>To be fair, this undying remembrance is not “for his good,” but it is for ours, and we glorify God because of Nehemiah, so perhaps it is for his good after all.</p>

<p>Some incredible visuals, though. 🍿</p>

<p>The inside is apparently some sort of digital art museum and cultural archive, but Meera and I didn’t have the time or the energy to tour it in between chocolate and beer tastings while we were in Brussels (July 2024). We almost always enjoy a good museum, but we really didn’t want to spend another day walking around inside when the outside looked like it did in the picture.</p>
<p>So we took the metro out there, observed a super-cool building, then took the metro right back to Grand Place and sat down for a drink and a snack.</p>

			 <p>I converted <a href="https://jerrytowler.com">my microblog</a> to be my primary home page.</p>
<p>First, I converted my microblog to the Alpine theme. I love the aesthetics of the <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/18">Tufte theme</a> (<a href="https://github.com/pimoore/microdotblog-tufte">GitHub</a>) I was using by <a href="https://micro.blog/pimoore">@pimoore</a>, but it hasn&rsquo;t been updated in a while and Micro.blog has been adding features rapidly.</p>
<p>I briefly flirted with <a href="https://micro.blog/mtt">@mtt</a>’s <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/96">Tiny Theme</a> for its flexibility, but I like the out-of-the-box behavior of Alpine better.</p>
<p>But if it was going to be my home page, I wanted it to be a little richer. <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.manton.org">home page</a> is quite stark, which is probably what he wants: it drastically centers the microblog.</p>
<p>But I wanted more.</p>
<p>So I dug into the theme and made a few changes: I added a second column for photos posts (based on a category)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, which meant I had to add a little more space. By default, the column of posts is only <code>700px</code> wide; mine is <code>55em</code> wide.</p>
<p>The attached picture is my previous home page, made using Jekyll’s Compass theme, for posterity.</p>

<p>A critical reminder that being the kind of person you feel you ought to be is impossible, and that’s okay—perhaps even freeing, when considered rightly.</p>
<p>Burkeman spends a lot of time repeating himself, but perhaps that’s part of the point: by repeatedly learning another way in which we can never “spend” time optimally, he maybe hopes to get just one ounce of understanding through.</p>
<p>That said, I found the nihilism offputting, even though I suspect he would argue that it’s not nihilism but realism.

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593544853">Slow Productivity</a> by Cal Newport.</p>
<p>What a spectacular book for post-pandemic white-collar knowledge work. Partly philosophical and partly actionable, Newport says maybe we should step back from the cliff of minute-to-minute “pseudo-productivity” and consider the contribution of our entire lives or careers.</p>
<p>The hardest part for me is that I recognize everything he says in my workplace but I’m concerned about how radical even the lightweight suggestions he gives would be. I guess that’s an indication I should start implementing.

<p>This world of forgotten gods where prayer and worship actually affect their powers continues to fascinate me, but unfortunately the writing doesn’t measure up to the story. Too many threads opened without closure, as if the author assumes you can just open the next book. It’s possible to do this well in a series, and many authors have—just not this one.</p>
<p>Enjoyed the read, and I’ll probably pick up the next one, but I wish it had a better editor.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781938570414">The Sunlit Man</a> by Brandon Sanderson</p>
<p>Apparently Sanderson’s fiftieth novel, and the last of the four Kickstarter books. Directly impacts the Cosmere, and the first of these weird ones where having read <em>everything</em> Cosmere really helps enrich the story.</p>
<p>A swashbuckling adventure—seriously. But of course with magic and mystery you expect.</p>
<p>My only complaint is that so much of the mystery of the early books is gone—we know so much now about Investiture and such that I’m no longer dazzled by it.</p>
<p>Still, a fun read.

<p>A fantastic addition to <em>Mythos</em>. Fry picks some of the best-known Greek heros (and one not-so-well-known) and brings them and their complete stories to life. He tells complete stories, bringing in all the crazy background and mythological history and real history. You get modern geography and philosophy and demography alongside Theseus and Perseus.</p>
<p>I have no nits to pick, except that again the audiobook, while delivered excellently by Fry himself, is mastered poorly, so keep your volume knob handy. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781405934138">Mythos</a> by Stephen Fry.</p>
<p>Excellent retelling of the classic Greek myths. Plus some I’ve never heard. If you ever read (or refused to read) Edith Hamilton’s <em>Mythology</em>, you owe it to yourself to read this one. Fry brings the characters and stories to dramatic life, truly retelling rather than just reciting.</p>
<p>The audiobook was absolutely worth it—Stephen Fry reads it himself and is engaging and hilarious as always—although the dynamic range is incredibly high, so be careful with your volume. 📚</p>

<p>The day after Christmas for us is always a chance to get outside. December 23 is often a travel day; Christmas Eve is full of cooking and wrapping and worship; and Christmas is full of eating and unwrapping and family. At that point, everybody needs a break and some fresh air.</p>
<p>So of course we had to take them down to the Riverwalk, where we apparently convinced them to take this very nice picture of just the two of us.</p>

			 <p>In September 2021, we spent a couple of days in Barcelona on our way back from Minorca and Mallorca. We had read that a favorite local breakfast spot was <a href="https://americansinbarcelona.com/granja-viader/">Granja M. Viader</a>. Usually, that means there’s a line of tourists out the door, and Meera and I are almost always unwilling to wait in a line like that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, this day, the line was practically nonexistent (probably because tourists hadn’t yet come back after COVID), and we slipped in for a breakfast of hot chocolate and churros.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Two things stood out from this visit:</p>
<ol>
<li>The hot chocolate was in fact thick warmed chocolate to dip the churros in. Those familiar with Spanish or Mexican culture are rolling their eyes, but this treat was new to me.</li>
<li>This restaurant has been serving this food for <strong>150 years</strong>. Incredible longevity for a breakfast spot.</li>
</ol>
<p>When we travel, I’m always torn between visiting the famous spots and being too much of a tourist. In this case, we threaded the needle perfectly and got an amazing unexpected breakfast. ✈️ 🗺️ 🇪🇸</p>

			 <p>Flying west across the international date line always screws with my “streaks.” Games, fitness—anything that automatically tracks daily continuity breaks.</p>

<p>Shawn Blanc offered <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/2019/11/how-to-have-a-recovery-day-with-the-apple-watch/">a solution</a>, and here’s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gentler-streak-activity-rest/id1576857102">a fitness app</a> with a graceful (they call it “self-compassionate”) third-party approach, but first-party apps should really support this kind of thing too.</p>

			 <p>Finally in our hotel in Melbourne. Quick recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>At 2pm Friday everything was fine.</li>
<li>At 3pm Friday our Melbourne flight was delayed two hours, but our Dallas flight was delayed <em>four</em> hours, so we would miss our connection, and the next DFW-MEL flight didn’t leave for two more days.</li>
<li>American couldn’t rebook us despite my platinum status. Our travel department figured out how to get us there through LAX, but before that a colleague traveling with us with Concierge Key status got us not only rebooked but on standby with a third alternative (which we ended up taking). If only American cared that much about all its passengers.</li>
<li>We made DFW, but all the gates were occupied, so we sat on the tarmac until one cleared up.</li>
<li>After getting into the airport, we closed down the Flagship Lounge (it inexplicably closes at 10:15pm even though the last flight boards much later), enjoying champagne, beers, cocktails, and even some dinner while we waited.</li>
<li>Our Melbourne flight was late arriving, so it was very late boarding, and we didn’t take off until 12:30am or later.</li>
<li>Seventeen and a half hours later, we landed in Melbourne around 7:30am.</li>
<li>Obviously we were too early to check in, so we dropped our bags at the hotel, got coffee and breakfast, and went exploring at the river, botanical gardens, and CBD.</li>
<li>We returned to the hotel for a break before venturing back out for dinner.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s been quite a ridiculous 34 hours, but we are excited to be here. Now for that nap…</p>

The iOS apps don&rsquo;t really believe in the share sheet (sharing to Sunlit loses my post 100% of the time), and scrolling in the official micro.blog app routinely breaks, making scrolling to the bottom of the post to continue writing impossible. I&rsquo;d switch to Drafts, but I still need to handle photo uploading. (To be fair, Epilogue continues to be awesome, and I&rsquo;ve never tried Wavelength.)</p>

			 <p>In 2019, my wife and I joined another couple for <a href="https://savvyhedgehog.com/backpacking-colorados-san-juan-mountains/">a backpacking trip</a> in the San Juan Mountains of south-central Colorado. On the way back, we stopped for a day at my in-law’s condo in Ruidoso, New Mexico to recover a bit. But instead of resting and recuperating from a challenging hike, we decided to go for <em>another</em> hike in the nearby Lincoln National Forest.</p>
<p>Okay, this one is entirely my fault.</p>
<p>I thought, hey, without 30–40 pounds on our backs, how hard could it be?</p>
<p>But the day was hot and the trail had depressingly little shade, so halfway through, I snapped this picture of us in front of Grindstone Lake, and we turned around and went home.</p>

			 <p>I came across this March 2022 post about <a href="https://chrishannah.me/having-control-over-your-own-day/">having control over your day</a> by <a href="https://micro.blog/ChrisHannah">@ChrisHannah</a>, where they advocate for flexible working hours:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Personally, I think the best solution for people and companies (where the job allows), is if your entire working hours were flexible. For example, you could be contracted to work 8 hours a day, but you are free to fulfil those 8 hours between the hours of 7 am and 9 pm. Maybe one day you have plans later on in the day, so you choose to start at 7 am, and have a short lunch. But another day, you want to go have brunch with friends, so you could start later, or perhaps you just take a long break?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My employer has had for many years exactly such a model: we are expected to be &ldquo;online&rdquo;—that is, generally available and working, not necessarily actually logged into Teams—from 9am–3pm Monday–Friday, and we are expected to log 80 hours every two weeks (we&rsquo;re a research consultancy, so we take both &ldquo;log&rdquo; and &ldquo;80 hours&rdquo; both seriously and literally). We&rsquo;re also expected to &ldquo;work from site&rdquo; Tuesday–Thursday, with Mondays and Fridays being optional work-from-home days. Beyond those constraints, we&rsquo;re free to flex our schedule in the way that lets us do our best work.</p>
<p>As a manager, I often field questions about why our policies are not even <em>more</em> flexible, and even I think of us as stuck in the past in many ways. So I appreciated seeing a proposal for improvement that we have already engaged, suggesting that perhaps things are not always better everywhere else.</p>

<p>I’ve taken some pretty pictures, but I think the best one I’ve ever taken is of a couple I don’t know and never met, on the beach of Lake Wakatipu in Queenstown, New Zealand. I hope they don’t mind, and I hope if they ever come across this post, they’ll appreciate how perfect their moment was (and say hi!). ✈️ 🗺️ 🇳🇿</p>

			 <p>Since the ongoing implosion of X, née Twitter, began, I’ve been combing through my archive of 15,000-ish tweets across 15 years since April 20, 2008.</p>
<p>It’s the longest record of anything in my life, stretching back further than my oldest Day One entry<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I remember almost all of it. Sometimes that’s good: starting in 2017, I published almost 90,000 words of Bible analysis to Twitter. Sometimes that’s bad: I spent a lot of days over the years angry about American politics—left and right—screaming impotently into the void instead of building something valuable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to change that; moving here is helping. I find that here I write with more intentionality. The sense of presence, permanence, and possession encourages me to think more—not too much more, I hope—before hitting &ldquo;Post.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while this treatment works well for the Old Testament and most of the Gospels, they abridge Acts too much, and the rest of the New Testament disappears until Revelation 22. I know it doesn’t fit the format, but ironically one of the elided verses (2 Timothy 3:16) says, “<em>all</em> Scripture is useful.” 📚</p>

			 <p>We have tried a bunch of non-alcoholic (n/a) beers lately, looking for something that satisfies the desire for something bubbly and refreshing but doesn&rsquo;t have the associated buzz, drowsiness, lack of focus, terrible sleep, and other downsides of the high-ABV beverages we&rsquo;ve come to enjoy.</p>
<p>This is an unordered list of the ones we&rsquo;ve tried with comments where applicable. All drinks with the same name as alcoholic beers are the non-alcoholic versions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://athleticbrewing.com">Athletic</a> - has a ton of different flavors, most of them very expensive (&gt;$2/drink on their website); we&rsquo;ve only tried the beers, not the seltzers
<ul>
<li>Upside Dawn - a golden ale that has nothing to do with golden ale, but is tasty nonetheless; my wife&rsquo;s favorite n/a beer</li>
<li>Cerveza Atletica - my wife&rsquo;s second-favorite n/a beer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brooklyn Brewery <a href="https://brooklynbrewery.com/brooklyn-beers/non-alcoholic/special-effects-variety-pack/">Special Effects</a>
<ul>
<li>Hoppy Amber - not on the top of my list for n/a beers, but comes in the variety pack, so what are you going to do?</li>
<li>IPA - a little bit thicker than a real IPA would be, but without the bite of alcohol to balance it out</li>
<li>Pils - I don&rsquo;t love alcoholic pils, so I&rsquo;m not to be trusted, but it&rsquo;s just as crisp and satisfying after a day in the woods (or the yard)</li>
<li>Hazy IPA - delicious; as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, nearly a complete beer substitute—as long as you only like one flavor of IPA, because this is the only one I&rsquo;ve found that&rsquo;s this good</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deschutes <a href="https://www.deschutesbrewery.com/beer/na-black-butte-/">Black Butte Porter</a> - different from the real thing, but delicious.</li>
<li>Sierra Nevada <a href="https://sierranevada.com/brews/hop-splash/">Hop Splash</a> &ldquo;hop water&rdquo; - a weird beverage that reminds you of beer but clearly isn&rsquo;t trying to actually be beer; recommended despite my use of the word &ldquo;weird&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="drinks-that-have-been-suggested-to-us-but-which-we-havent-tried-yet">Drinks that have been suggested to us, but which we haven&rsquo;t tried yet</h2>

<p>We still love great beers and ciders, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll see us at <a href="https://thedooryardsa.com">The Dooryard</a> this weekend, but this kind of variety is a wonderful change from the previous alcohol-or-nothing regime.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780310113188">For the Body</a> by Timothy C. Tennent. A critical exposition of the need for the modern church to develop and espouse a positive theology of the body rather than the decades of pure negative theology: “don’t do that; that’s wrong.”</p>
<p>A great starter book on the topic, although the last two chapters are aimed squarely at pastors, not laypeople (they still have value, but not as much).</p>
<p>My primary takeaway is that developing a positive, holistic theology of the body allows us to see our sexuality, our bodies, and ourselves in the context of the complete gospel, not by the light of a few specific verses that mostly just make people angry regardless of what they believe. 📚</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Back in 2014, there was a Twitter account, or maybe a Tumblr account, that published pop songs as sonnets<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I loved the spin on genre, but I noticed that they were all Petrarchan (Italian) sonnets, which go ABBA ABBA CDE CDE, or Shakespearean (English) sonnets, which go ABAB CDCD EFEF GG.</p>
<p>I complained on Twitter that we needed Spenserian ones, which have a harder rhyme scheme: ABAB BCBC CDCD EE. But you shouldn&rsquo;t complain without offering a solution, so I give you my offering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tho' oft my speech ere uttering seem mad,<br>
Fair Helios signals end of labor&rsquo;s reign<br>
O&rsquo;er you and I, who, lightened, upward gad&mdash;<br>
Ascend beyond the heav&rsquo;ns' celestial plane<br>
Lo, trumpets sound our doom, and promise pain:<br>
Your harbinger I welcome, arms ope&rsquo;d wide<br>
For I, clothèd in joy, will be not slain<br>
Let not your countenance be hurt, nor pride<br>
Know I, and I alone, yield to no tide<br>
No force of earth, nor beast, nor god could quell<br>
The rise and rise unstoppable inside<br>
Of happiness whose bounds no man can tell<br>
&mdash;Now strike! your hands together, join the din<br>
A roofless room, a bonafide boon, within.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been obsessed with Demonin&rsquo;s <a href="https://demonin.com/games/arrayGame/">Array Game</a> since Andy Baio <a href="https://waxy.org/2023/06/array-game/">linked to it</a> a month ago.</p>
<p>After getting effectively to the current endgame (there&rsquo;s no real end, but at some point there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;next upgrade&rdquo;), it occurred to me that the simplicity of the game was ideal for me to try learning Swift again.</p>
<p>I dove all the way into Swift and SwiftUI, first using <a href="https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/">Swift Playgrounds</a> and then Xcode directly. It&rsquo;s amazing how quickly a simple app can come together using all these tools and the crazy-fast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> that is Playgrounds.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video of the first level as of today.</p>

			 <p>I just accidentally used the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212757">Universal Control</a> feature built into macOS Ventura. I had set up my work MacBook Pro next to the monitor for my personal Mac mini, where I used to keep my laptop when it was connected to this monitor. So I naturally just hauled the cursor beyond the side of the screen, and it <em>magically</em> kept going onto the laptop screen!</p>
<p>It took me several seconds to figure out that something special had happened and that my cursor had jumped from one machine to the other.</p>
<p>Something weird: how did it know which side of my monitor the laptop was on? It could guess by choosing the direction you try to move your cursor, exactly like I did, but it&rsquo;s still absolutely delightful.</p>

<p>Little snippets that are helpful to me now and might be helpful to me or others later.</p>
<p>Some of them are very #wisdom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like it or not, you&rsquo;re always practicing something. Put another way, whichever muscle you exercise the most can&rsquo;t help but strengthen. Often to the detriment of others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And some are pure Merlin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your calendar represents a portfolio of promises to your future self. Treat it that way.</p>

			 <p>Cleaning out and backing up my college/grad school MacBook Pro (15-inch Early 2008), and the nostalgia is strong in this one.</p>
<p>Sure, its 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo isn’t that impressive, and neither is its 4GB of DDR2 or 256GB GeForce 8600M, but it is weirdly performant on OS X 10.8.3, and the aesthetic is arguably more beautiful and indisputably more fun than current macOS.</p>
<p>The old-school 3D icons for Twitter, TextWrangler, and others are elegant, and maybe we should go back to them.</p>
<p>I did all of grad school on this computer, including tons of Matlab and hundreds of pages of LaTeX, and it’s kind of sad to see it go.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780345522870">Crucible of Gold</a> by Naomi Novik. Fantastic adventure in the Andes devolves to more boring British politics by the end. Novik loves the history of the Napoleonic wars too much, and it weakens the stories. 📚</p>

The climax is too long in coming though, and too short; similarly, the denouement is precipitous. 📚</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780613572781">Sourcery</a> by Terry Pratchett. The self-consistency of Discworld, despite the total lack of logic, amazes me every time. All of its legends and myths and prophecies are true, just never in ways the reader expects, yet somehow always in ways that blend comfortably with the overall chaos. 📚</p>
